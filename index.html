<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Signed languages (also known as sign languages) are languages that use the visual-gestural modality to convey meaning through manual articulations in combination with non-manual elements like the face and body. They serve as the primary means of communication for numerous deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. Similar to spoken languages, signed languages are natural languages governed by a set of linguistic rules <span class="citation" data-cites="sandler2006sign">(Sandler and Lillo-Martin <a href="#ref-sandler2006sign" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, both emerging through an abstract, protracted aging process and evolving without deliberate meticulous planning. Signed languages are not universal or mutually intelligible, despite often having striking similarities among them. They are also distinct from spoken languages—i.e., American Sign Language (ASL) is not a visual form of English but its own unique language.</p>
<p>Sign Language Processing <span class="citation" data-cites="bragg2019sign yin-etal-2021-including">(Bragg et al. <a href="#ref-bragg2019sign" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; Yin et al. <a href="#ref-yin-etal-2021-including" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> is an emerging field of artificial intelligence concerned with the automatic processing and analysis of sign language content. While research has focused more on the visual aspects of signed languages, it is a subfield of both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). Challenges in sign language processing often include machine translation of sign language videos into spoken language text (sign language translation), from spoken language text (sign language production), or sign language recognition for sign language understanding.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the latest advances in language-based artificial intelligence, like machine translation and personal assistants, expect a spoken language input (text or transcribed speech), excluding around 200-to-300 different signed languages <span class="citation" data-cites="un2022">(United Nations <a href="#ref-un2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span> and up to 70 million deaf people <span class="citation" data-cites="who2021 wfd2022">(World Health Organization <a href="#ref-who2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>; World Federation of the Deaf <a href="#ref-wfd2022" role="doc-biblioref">2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Throughout history, Deaf communities fought for the right to learn and use signed languages and for the public recognition of signed languages as legitimate ones. Indeed, signed languages are sophisticated communication modalities, at least as capable as spoken languages in all aspects, both linguistic and social. However, in a predominantly oral society, deaf people are constantly encouraged to use spoken languages through lip-reading or text-based communication. The exclusion of signed languages from modern language technologies further suppresses signing in favor of spoken languages. This exclusion disregards the preferences of the Deaf communities who strongly prefer to communicate in signed languages both online and for in-person day-to-day interactions, among themselves and when interacting with spoken language communities <span class="citation" data-cites="padden1988deaf glickman2018language">(C. A. Padden and Humphries <a href="#ref-padden1988deaf" role="doc-biblioref">1988</a>; Glickman and Hall <a href="#ref-glickman2018language" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. Thus, it is essential to make signed languages accessible.</p>
<p>To date, a large amount of research on Sign Language Processing (SLP) has been focused on the visual aspect of signed languages, led by the Computer Vision (CV) community, with little NLP involvement. This focus is not unreasonable, given that a decade ago, we lacked adequate CV tools to process videos for further linguistic analyses. However, similar to spoken languages, signed languages are fully-fledged systems exhibiting all the fundamental characteristics of natural languages, and existing SLP techniques do not adequately address or leverage the linguistic structure of signed languages. Signed languages introduce novel challenges for NLP due to their visual-gestural modality, simultaneity, spatial coherence, and lack of written form. The lack of a written form makes the spoken language processing pipelines - which often start with audio transcription before processing - incompatible with signed languages, forcing researchers to work directly on the raw video signal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, SLP is not only intellectually appealing but also an important research area with significant potential to benefit signing communities. Beneficial applications enabled by signed language technologies include improved documentation of endangered sign languages; educational tools for sign language learners; tools for query and retrieval of information from signed language videos; personal assistants that react to signed languages; real-time automatic sign language interpretations; and more. Needless to say, in addressing this research area, researchers should work <em>alongside</em> and <em>under the direction of</em> deaf communities, and to benefit the signing communities’ interest above all <span class="citation" data-cites="harris2009research">(Harris, Holmes, and Mertens <a href="#ref-harris2009research" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In this work, we describe the different representations used for sign language processing, as well as survey the various tasks and recent advances on them. We also make a comprehensive list of existing datasets and make the ones available easy to load using a simple and standardized interface.</p>
<h3 id="brief-history-of-signed-languages-and-deaf-culture">(Brief) History of Signed Languages and Deaf Culture</h3>
<p>Throughout modern history, spoken languages were dominant, so much so that signed languages struggled to be recognized as languages in their own right and educators developed misconceptions that signed language acquisition might hinder the development of speech skills. For example, in 1880, a large international conference of deaf educators called the “Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf” banned teaching signed languages, favoring speech therapy instead. It was not until the seminal work on American Sign Language (ASL) by <span class="citation" data-cites="writing:stokoe1960sign">Stokoe (<a href="#ref-writing:stokoe1960sign" role="doc-biblioref">1960</a>)</span> that signed languages started gaining recognition as natural, independent, and well-defined languages, which inspired other researchers to further explore signed languages as a research area. Nevertheless, antiquated notions that deprioritized signed languages continue to do harm and subjects many to linguistic neglect <span class="citation" data-cites="humphries2016avoiding">(Humphries et al. <a href="#ref-humphries2016avoiding" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. Several studies have shown that deaf children raised solely with spoken languages do not gain enough access to a first language during their critical period of language acquisition <span class="citation" data-cites="murray2020importance">(Murray, Hall, and Snoddon <a href="#ref-murray2020importance" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. This language deprivation can lead to life-long consequences on the cognitive, linguistic, socio-emotional, and academic development of the deaf <span class="citation" data-cites="hall2017language">(Hall, Levin, and Anderson <a href="#ref-hall2017language" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Signed languages are the primary languages of communication for the Deaf<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and are at the heart of Deaf communities. In the past, the failure to recognize signed languages as fully-fledged natural language systems in their own right has had detrimental effects, and in an increasingly digitized world, NLP research should strive to enable a world in which all people, including the Deaf, have access to languages that fit their lived experience.</p>
<h2 id="sign-language-linguistics-overview">Sign Language Linguistics Overview</h2>
<p>Signed languages consist of phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic levels of structure that fulfill the same social, cognitive, and communicative purposes as other natural languages. While spoken languages primarily channel the oral-auditory modality, signed languages use the visual-gestural modality, relying on the signer’s face, hands, body, and space around them to create distinctions in meaning. We present the linguistic features of signed languages<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> that researchers must consider during their modeling.</p>
<section id="phonology" class="unnumbered">
<h6 class="unnumbered">Phonology</h6>
<p>Signs are composed of minimal units that combine manual features such as hand configuration, palm orientation, placement, contact, path movement, local movement, as well as non-manual features including eye aperture, head movement, and torso positioning <span class="citation" data-cites="liddell1989american johnson2011toward brentari2011sign sandler2012phonological">(Liddell and Johnson <a href="#ref-liddell1989american" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>; Johnson and Liddell <a href="#ref-johnson2011toward" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>; Brentari <a href="#ref-brentari2011sign" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>; Sandler <a href="#ref-sandler2012phonological" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. Not all possible phonemes are realized in both signed and spoken languages, and inventories of two languages’ phonemes/features may not overlap completely. Different languages are also subject to rules for the allowed combinations of features.</p>
</section>
<section id="simultaneity" class="unnumbered">
<h6 class="unnumbered">Simultaneity</h6>
<p>Though an ASL sign takes about twice as long to produce than an English word, the rates of transmission of information between the two languages are similar <span class="citation" data-cites="bellugi1972comparison">(Bellugi and Fischer <a href="#ref-bellugi1972comparison" role="doc-biblioref">1972</a>)</span>. One way signed languages compensate for the slower production rate of signs is through simultaneity: Signed languages use multiple visual cues to convey different information simultaneously <span class="citation" data-cites="sandler2012phonological">(Sandler <a href="#ref-sandler2012phonological" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. For example, the signer may produce the sign for ‘cup’ on one hand while simultaneously pointing to the actual cup with the other to express ``that cup’’. Similarly to tone in spoken languages, the face and torso can convey additional affective information <span class="citation" data-cites="liddell2003grammar johnston2007australian">(Liddell and others <a href="#ref-liddell2003grammar" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>; Johnston and Schembri <a href="#ref-johnston2007australian" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>. Facial expressions can modify adjectives, adverbs, and verbs; a head shake can negate a phrase or sentence; eye direction can help indicate referents.</p>
</section>
<section id="referencing" class="unnumbered">
<h6 class="unnumbered">Referencing</h6>
<p>The signer can introduce referents in discourse either by pointing to their actual locations in space or by assigning a region in the signing space to a non-present referent and by pointing to this region to refer to it <span class="citation" data-cites="rathmann2011featural schembri2018indicating">(Rathmann and Mathur <a href="#ref-rathmann2011featural" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>; Schembri, Cormier, and Fenlon <a href="#ref-schembri2018indicating" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. Signers can also establish relations between referents grounded in signing space by using directional signs or embodying the referents using body shift or eye gaze <span class="citation" data-cites="dudis2004body liddell1998gesture">(Dudis <a href="#ref-dudis2004body" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>; Liddell and Metzger <a href="#ref-liddell1998gesture" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>. Spatial referencing also impact morphology when the directionality of a verb depends on the location of the reference to its subject and/or object <span class="citation" data-cites="de2008pointing fenlon2018modification">(Beuzeville <a href="#ref-de2008pointing" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>; Fenlon, Schembri, and Cormier <a href="#ref-fenlon2018modification" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>: For example, a directional verb can move from its subject’s location and end at its object’s location. While the relation between referents and verbs in spoken language is more arbitrary, referent relations are usually grounded in signed languages. The visual space is heavily exploited to make referencing clear.</p>
<p>Another way anaphoric entities are referenced in sign language is by using classifiers or depicting signs <span class="citation" data-cites="supalla1986classifier wilcox2004rethinking roy2011discourse">(Supalla <a href="#ref-supalla1986classifier" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a>; Wilcox and Hafer <a href="#ref-wilcox2004rethinking" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>; Roy <a href="#ref-roy2011discourse" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> that help describe the characteristics of the referent. Classifiers are typically one-handed signs that do not have a particular location or movement assigned to them, or derive features from meaningful discourse <span class="citation" data-cites="liddell2003grammar">(Liddell and others <a href="#ref-liddell2003grammar" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>, so they can be used to convey how the referent relates to other entities, describe its movement, and give more details. For example, to tell about a car swerving and crashing, one might use the hand classifier for a vehicle, move it to indicate swerving, and crash it with another entity in space.</p>
<p>To quote someone other than oneself, signers perform <em>role shift</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="cormier2015rethinking">(Cormier, Smith, and Sevcikova-Sehyr <a href="#ref-cormier2015rethinking" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, where they may physically shift in space to mark the distinction and take on some characteristics of the people they represent. For example, to recount a dialogue between a taller and a shorter person, the signer may shift to one side and look up when taking the shorter person’s role, shift to the other side and look down when taking the taller person’s role.</p>
</section>
<section id="fingerspelling" class="unnumbered">
<h6 class="unnumbered">Fingerspelling</h6>
<p>Fingerspelling results from language contact between a signed language and a surrounding spoken language written form <span class="citation" data-cites="battison1978lexical wilcox1992phonetics brentari2001language patrie2011fingerspelled">(Battison <a href="#ref-battison1978lexical" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>; Wilcox <a href="#ref-wilcox1992phonetics" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>; Brentari and Padden <a href="#ref-brentari2001language" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>; Patrie and Johnson <a href="#ref-patrie2011fingerspelled" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>. A set of manual gestures correspond with a written orthography or phonetic system. This phenomenon, found in most signed languages, is often used to indicate names or places or new concepts from the spoken language but has often become integrated into the signed languages as another linguistic strategy <span class="citation" data-cites="padden1998asl montemurro2018emphatic">(Padden <a href="#ref-padden1998asl" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>; Montemurro and Brentari <a href="#ref-montemurro2018emphatic" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="sign-language-representations">Sign Language Representations</h2>
<p>Representation is a significant challenge for SLP. Unlike spoken languages, signed languages have no widely adopted written form. As signed languages are conveyed through the visual-gestural modality, video recording is the most straightforward way to capture them. However, as videos include more information than needed for modeling and are expensive to record, store, and transmit, a lower-dimensional representation has been sought after.</p>
<p>The following figure illustrates each signed language representation we will describe below. In this demonstration, we deconstruct the video into its individual frames to exemplify the alignment of the annotations between the video and representations.</p>
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="assets/representation/continuous.pdf#toolbar=0&navpanes=0&scrollbar=0" id="continuous-rep"></object>
<section id="videos" class="unnumbered">
<h6 class="unnumbered">Videos</h6>
<p>are the most straightforward representation of a signed language and can amply incorporate the information conveyed through signing. One major drawback of using videos is their high dimensionality: They usually include more information than needed for modeling and are expensive to store, transmit, and encode. As facial features are essential in sign, anonymizing raw videos remains an open problem, limiting the possibility of making these videos publicly available <span class="citation" data-cites="isard2020approaches">(Isard <a href="#ref-isard2020approaches" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="skeletal-poses" class="unnumbered">
<h6 class="unnumbered">Skeletal Poses</h6>
<p>reduce the visual cues in videos to skeleton-like wireframes or mesh representing the location of joints. This technique has been extensively used in the field of computer vision to estimate human pose from video data, where the goal is to determine the spatial configuration of the body at each point in time. Although high-quality pose estimation can be achieved using motion capture equipment, such methods are often expensive and intrusive. As a result, estimating pose from videos has become the preferred method in recent years <span class="citation" data-cites="pose:pishchulin2012articulated pose:chen2017adversarial pose:cao2018openpose pose:alp2018densepose">(Pishchulin et al. <a href="#ref-pose:pishchulin2012articulated" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>; Chen et al. <a href="#ref-pose:chen2017adversarial" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>; Cao et al. <a href="#ref-pose:cao2018openpose" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; Güler, Neverova, and Kokkinos <a href="#ref-pose:alp2018densepose" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. Compared to video representations, accurate skeletal poses have a lower complexity and provide a semi-anonymized representation of the human body, while observing relatively low information loss. However, they remain a continuous, multidimensional representation that is not adapted to most NLP models.</p>

<p>So far, the computer vision community has mainly led the SLP research to focus on processing the visual features in signed language videos. As a result, current SLP methods do not fully address the linguistic complexity of signed languages. We survey common SLP tasks and current methods’ limitations, drawing on signed languages’ linguistic theories.</p>

However, as VAD methods often rely on speech-specific representations such as spectrograms, they are not necessarily applicable to videos.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="detection:borg2019sign">Borg and Camilleri (<a href="#ref-detection:borg2019sign" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> introduced the classification of frames taken from YouTube videos as either signing or not.

(<a href="#ref-detection:moryossef2020real" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> improved upon their method by performing sign language detection in real time. They identified that sign language use involves movement of the body and, as such, designed a model that works on top of estimated human poses rather than directly on the video signal. They calculate the optical flow norm of every joint detected on the body and apply a shallow yet effective contextualized model to predict for every frame whether the person is signing or not.</p>
<p>While these recent detection models achieve high performance, we need well-annotated data that include interference and distractions with non-signing instances for proper real-world evaluation.</p>

<p>Segmentation consists of detecting the frame boundaries for signs or phrases in videos to divide them into meaningful units.

<h4 id="video-to-pose">Video-to-Pose</h4>
<p>Video-to-Pose—commonly known as pose estimation—is the task of detecting human figures in images and videos, so that one could determine, for example, where someone’s elbow shows up in an image. It was shown <span class="citation" data-cites="vogler2005analysis">(Vogler and Goldenstein <a href="#ref-vogler2005analysis" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> that the face pose correlates with facial non-manual features like head direction.</p>

While their model can estimate the full pose directly from an image in a single inference, they also suggest a pipeline approach where they first estimate the body pose and then independently estimate the hands and face pose by acquiring higher resolution crops around those areas. Building on the slow pipeline approach, a single network whole body OpenPose model has been proposed <span class="citation" data-cites="pose:hidalgo2019singlenetwork">(Hidalgo et al. <a href="#ref-pose:hidalgo2019singlenetwork" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, which is faster and more accurate for the case of obtaining all keypoints. With multiple recording angles, OpenPose also offers keypoint triangulation to reconstruct the pose in 3D.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="pose:alp2018densepose">Güler, Neverova, and Kokkinos (<a href="#ref-pose:alp2018densepose" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> take a different approach with DensePose. Instead of classifying for every keypoint which pixel is most likely, they suggest similar to semantic segmentation, for each pixel to classify which body part it belongs to. Then, for each pixel, knowing the body part, they predict where that pixel is on the body part relative to a 2D projection of a representative body model. This approach results in the reconstruction of the full-body mesh and allows sampling to find specific keypoints similar to OpenPose.</p>
<p>However, 2D human poses might not be sufficient to fully understand the position and orientation of landmarks in space, and applying pose estimation per frame does not take the video temporal movement information into account, especially in cases of rapid movement, which contain motion blur.</p>

The second is an unsupervised method, leveraging the fact that the 2D poses are merely a projection of an unknown 3D pose and train a model to estimate the 3D pose and back-project to the input 2D poses. This back projection is a deterministic process, applying constraints on the 3D pose encoder. <span class="citation" data-cites="pose:zelinka2020neural">Zelinka and Kanis (<a href="#ref-pose:zelinka2020neural" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> follow a similar process and adds a constraint for bones to stay of a fixed length between frames.</p>

Demonstrating their approach to hand pose estimation, they manually explicitly encode the constraints and limits of each joint, resulting in 26 degrees of freedom. Then, non-linear least-squares minimization fits a 3D model of the hand to the estimated 2D joint positions, recovering the 3D hand pose. This process is similar to the back-projection used by <span class="citation" data-cites="pose:pavllo20193d">Pavllo et al.

Specifically, they use a Sign Language Graph Convolution Network (SL-GCN) to model the embedded dynamics of skeleton keypoints and a Separable Spatial-Temporal Convolution Network (SSTCN) to exploit skeleton features. The proposed late-fusion GEM fuses the skeleton-based predictions with other RGB and depth-based modalities to provide global information and make an accurate SLR prediction.</p>

<h3 id="fingerspelling-1">Fingerspelling</h3>
<p>Fingerspelling is spelling a word letter-by-letter, borrowing from the spoken language alphabet <span class="citation" data-cites="battison1978lexical wilcox1992phonetics brentari2001language patrie2011fingerspelled">(Battison <a href="#ref-battison1978lexical" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>; Wilcox <a href="#ref-wilcox1992phonetics" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>; Brentari and Padden <a href="#ref-brentari2001language" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>; Patrie and Johnson <a href="#ref-patrie2011fingerspelled" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>. This phenomenon, found in most signed languages, often occurs when there is no previously agreed-upon sign for a concept, like in technical language, colloquial conversations involving names, conversations involving current events, emphatic forms, and the context of code-switching between the sign language and corresponding spoken language <span class="citation" data-cites="padden1998asl montemurro2018emphatic">(Padden <a href="#ref-padden1998asl" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>; Montemurro and Brentari <a href="#ref-montemurro2018emphatic" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. The relative amount of fingerspelling varies between signed languages, and for American Sign Language (ASL), it accounts for 12–35% of the signed content <span class="citation" data-cites="padden2003alphabet">(Padden and Gunsauls <a href="#ref-padden2003alphabet" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="patrie2011fingerspelled">Patrie and Johnson (<a href="#ref-patrie2011fingerspelled" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> describe the following terminology to describe three different forms of fingerspelling:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Careful</strong>—slower spelling where each letter pose is clearly formed.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid</strong>—quick spelling where letters are often not completed and contain remnants of other letters in the word.</li>
<li><strong>Lexicalized</strong>—a sign produced by often using no more than two letter-hand-shapes <span class="citation" data-cites="battison1978lexical">(Battison <a href="#ref-battison1978lexical" role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span>.<br> For example, lexicalized <code>ALL</code> uses <code>A</code> and <code>L</code>, lexicalized <code>BUZZ</code> uses <code>B</code> and <code>Z</code>, etc…</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="recognition">Recognition</h4>
<p>Fingerspelling recognition–a sub-task of sign language recognition–is the task of recognizing fingerspelled words from a sign language video.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="dataset:fs18slt">Shi et al. (<a href="#ref-dataset:fs18slt" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> introduced a large dataset available for American Sign Language fingerspelling recognition. This dataset includes both the “careful” and “rapid” forms of fingerspelling collected from naturally occurring videos “in the wild”, which are more challenging than studio conditions. They train a baseline model to take a sequence of images cropped around the signing hand and either use an autoregressive decoder or a CTC. They found that the CTC outperforms the autoregressive decoder model, but both achieve poor recognition rates (35-41% character level accuracy) compared to human performance (around 82%).</p>
<p>In follow-up work, <span class="citation" data-cites="dataset:fs18iccv">Shi et al. (<a href="#ref-dataset:fs18iccv" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> collected nearly an order-of-magnitude larger dataset and designed a new recognition model. Instead of detecting the signing hand, they detect the face and crop a large area around it. Then, they perform an iterative process of zooming in to the hand using visual attention to retain sufficient information in high resolution of the hand. Finally, like their previous work, they encode the image hand crops sequence and use a CTC to obtain the frame labels. They show that this method outperforms their original “hand crop” method by 4% and that they can achieve up to 62.3% character-level accuracy using the additional data collected. Looking through this dataset, we note that the videos in the dataset are taken from longer videos, and as they are cut, they do not retain the signing before the fingerspelling. This context relates to language modeling, where at first, one fingerspells a word carefully, and when repeating it, might fingerspell it rapidly, but the interlocutors can infer they are fingerspelling the same word.</p>
<h4 id="production">Production</h4>
<p>Fingerspelling production–a sub-task of sign language production–is the task of producing a fingerspelling video for words.</p>
<p>In its basic form, “Careful” fingerspelling production can be trivially solved using pre-defined letter handshapes interpolation. <span class="citation" data-cites="adeline2013fingerspell">Adeline (<a href="#ref-adeline2013fingerspell" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> demonstrates this approach for American Sign Language and English fingerspelling. They rig a hand armature for each letter in the English alphabet (<span class="math inline"><em>N</em> = 26</span>) and generate all (<span class="math inline"><em>N</em><sup>2</sup> = 676</span>) transitions between every two letters using interpolation or manual animation. Then, to fingerspell entire words, they chain pairs of letter transitions. For example, for the word “CHLOE”, they would chain the following transitions sequentially: <code>#C</code> <code>CH</code> <code>HL</code> <code>LO</code> <code>OE</code> <code>E#</code>.</p>
<p>However, to produce life-like animations, one must also consider the rhythm and speed of holding letters, and transitioning between letters, as those can affect how intelligible fingerspelling motions are to an interlocutor (<span class="citation" data-cites="wilcox1992phonetics">Wilcox (<a href="#ref-wilcox1992phonetics" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span>). <span class="citation" data-cites="wheatland2016analysis">Wheatland et al. (<a href="#ref-wheatland2016analysis" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> analyzes both “careful” and “rapid” fingerspelling videos for these features. They find that for both forms of fingerspelling, on average, the longer the word, the shorter the transition and hold time. Furthermore, they find that less time is spent on middle letters on average, and the last letter is held on average for longer than the other letters in the word. Finally, they use this information to construct an animation system using letter pose interpolation and control the timing using a data-driven statistical model.</p>

<h6 class="unnumbered">Availability</h6>
<p>Unlike the vast amount and diversity of available spoken language resources that allow various applications, signed language resources are scarce and, currently only support translation and production. Unfortunately, most of the signed language corpora discussed in the literature are either not available for use or available under heavy restrictions and licensing terms. Furthermore, signed language data is especially challenging to anonymize due to the importance of facial and other physical features in signing videos, limiting its open distribution. Developing anonymization with minimal information loss or accurate anonymous representations is a promising research direction.</p>
</section>
<h3 id="collect-real-world-data">Collect Real-World Data</h3>
<p>Data is essential to develop any of the core NLP tools previously described, and current efforts in SLP are often limited by the lack of adequate data. We discuss the considerations to keep in mind when building datasets, the challenges of collecting such data, and directions to facilitate data collection.</p>
<section id="what-is-good-signed-language-data" class="unnumbered">
<h6 class="unnumbered">What is Good Signed Language Data?</h6>
<p>For SLP models to be deployable, they must be developed using data that represents the real world accurately. What constitutes an ideal signed language dataset is an open question, we suggest including the following requirements: (1) a broad domain; (2) sufficient data and vocabulary size; (3) real-world conditions; (4) naturally produced signs; (5) a diverse signer demographic; (6) native signers; and when applicable, (7) dense annotations.</p>
<p>To illustrate the importance of data quality during modeling, <span class="citation" data-cites="yin-etal-2021-including">Yin et al. (<a href="#ref-yin-etal-2021-including" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> first take as an example a current benchmark for SLP, the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset <span class="citation" data-cites="cihan2018neural">(Cihan Camgöz et al. <a href="#ref-cihan2018neural" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> of German Sign Language, that does not meet most of the above criteria: it is restricted to the weather domain (1); contains only around 8K segments with 1K unique signs (2); filmed in studio conditions (3); interpreted from German utterances (4); and signed by nine Caucasian interpreters (5,6). Although this dataset successfully addressed data scarcity issues at the time and successfully rendered results comparable and fueled competitive research, it does not accurately represent signed languages in the real world. On the other hand, the Public DGS Corpus <span class="citation" data-cites="dataset:hanke-etal-2020-extending">(Hanke et al. <a href="#ref-dataset:hanke-etal-2020-extending" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> is an open-domain (1) dataset consisting of 50 hours of natural signing (4) by 330 native signers from various regions in Germany (5,6), annotated with glosses, HamNoSys and German translations (7), meeting all but two requirements we suggest.</p>
<p>They train a gloss-to-text sign language translation transformer <span class="citation" data-cites="yin-read-2020-better">(Yin and Read <a href="#ref-yin-read-2020-better" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> on both datasets. On RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T, they obtain <strong>22.17</strong> BLEU on testing; on Public DGS Corpus, they obtain a mere  BLEU. Although Transformers achieve encouraging results on RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T <span class="citation" data-cites="saunders2020progressive camgoz2020multi">(Saunders, Camgöz, and Bowden <a href="#ref-saunders2020progressive" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a><a href="#ref-saunders2020progressive" role="doc-biblioref">c</a>; N.

These results reveal that, for real-world applications, we need more data to train such models. At the same time, available data is severely limited in size; less data-hungry and more linguistically-informed approaches may be more suitable. This experiment reveals how it is crucial to use data that accurately represent the complexity and diversity of signed languages to precisely assess what types of methods are suitable and how well our models would deploy to the real world.</p>
</section>
<section id="challenges-of-data-collection" class="unnumbered">
<h6 class="unnumbered">Challenges of Data Collection</h6>
<p>Collecting and annotating signed data in line with the ideal requires more resources than speech or text data, taking up to 600 minutes per minute of an annotated signed language video <span class="citation" data-cites="dataset:hanke-etal-2020-extending">(Hanke et al. <a href="#ref-dataset:hanke-etal-2020-extending" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. Moreover, annotation usually requires specific knowledge and skills, which makes recruiting or training qualified annotators challenging. Additionally, there is little existing signed language data in the wild openly licensed for use, especially from native signers that are not interpretations of speech. Therefore, data collection often requires significant efforts and costs of on-site recording.</p>
</section>
<section id="automating-annotation" class="unnumbered">
<h6 class="unnumbered">Automating Annotation</h6>
<p>One helpful research direction for collecting more data that enables the development of deployable SLP models is creating tools that can simplify or automate parts of the collection and annotation process. One of the most significant bottlenecks in obtaining more adequate signed language data is the time and scarcity of experts required to perform annotation. Therefore, tools that perform automatic parsing, detection of frame boundaries, extraction of articulatory features, suggestions for lexical annotations, and allow parts of the annotation process to be crowdsourced to non-experts, to name a few, have a high potential to facilitate and accelerate the availability of good data.</p>
</section>
<h3 id="practice-deaf-collaboration">Practice Deaf Collaboration</h3>
<p>Finally, when working with signed languages, it is vital to keep in mind  this technology should benefit and  they need. Researchers in SLP must honor that signed languages belong to the Deaf community and avoid exploiting their language as a commodity <span class="citation" data-cites="bird-2020-decolonising">(Bird <a href="#ref-bird-2020-decolonising" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<section id="solving-real-needs" class="unnumbered">
<h6 class="unnumbered">Solving Real Needs</h6>
<p>Many efforts in SLP have developed intrusive methods (e.g., requiring signers to wear special gloves), which are often rejected by signing communities and therefore have limited real-world value. Such efforts are often marketed to perform ``sign language translation" when they, in fact, only identify fingerspelling or recognize a minimal set of isolated signs at best. These approaches oversimplify the rich grammar of signed languages, promote the misconception that signs are solely expressed through the hands, and are considered by the Deaf community as a manifestation of audism, where it is the signers who must make the extra effort to wear additional sensors to be understood by non-signers <span class="citation" data-cites="erard2017sign">(Erard <a href="#ref-erard2017sign" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. To avoid such mistakes, we encourage close Deaf involvement throughout the research process to ensure that we direct our efforts toward applications that will be adopted by signers and do not make false assumptions about signed languages or the needs of signing communities.</p>
</section>
<section id="building-collaboration" class="unnumbered">
<h6 class="unnumbered">Building Collaboration</h6>
<p>Deaf collaborations and leadership are essential for developing signed language technologies to ensure they address the community’s needs and will be adopted, not relying on misconceptions or inaccuracies about signed language <span class="citation" data-cites="harris2009research kusters2017innovations">(Harris, Holmes, and Mertens <a href="#ref-harris2009research" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>; Annelies Kusters, De Meulder, and O’Brien <a href="#ref-kusters2017innovations" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. Hearing researchers cannot relate to the deaf experience or fully understand the context in which the tools being developed would be used, nor can they speak for the deaf. Therefore, we encourage creating a long-term collaborative environment between signed language researchers and users so that deaf users can identify meaningful challenges and provide insights on the considerations to take while researchers cater to the signers’ needs as the field evolves. We also recommend reaching out to signing communities for reviewing papers on signed languages to ensure an adequate evaluation of this type of research results published at ACL venues. There are several ways to connect with Deaf communities for collaboration: one can seek deaf students in their local community, reach out to schools for the deaf, contact deaf linguists, join a network of researchers of sign-related technologies, and/or participate in deaf-led projects.</p>
