## Introduction

Signed languages (also known as sign languages) are languages that use the visual-gestural modality to
convey meaning through manual articulations in combination with non-manual elements like the face and body.
They serve as the primary means of communication for numerous deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.
Similar to spoken languages, signed languages are natural languages governed by a set of linguistic rules [@sandler2006sign], 
both emerging through an abstract, protracted aging process and evolving without deliberate meticulous planning.
Signed languages are not universal or mutually intelligible, despite often having striking similarities among them.
They are also distinct from spoken languages---i.e., American Sign Language (ASL) is not a visual form of English 
but its own unique language.

Sign Language Processing [@bragg2019sign;@yin-etal-2021-including] is an emerging field of artificial intelligence concerned with the automatic processing and analysis of sign language content.
While research has focused more on the visual aspects of signed languages, 
it is a subfield of both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV).
Challenges in sign language processing often include machine translation of 
sign language videos into spoken language text (sign language translation),
from spoken language text (sign language production), 
or sign language recognition for sign language understanding.

Unfortunately, the latest advances in language-based artificial intelligence, like machine translation and personal assistants, 
expect a spoken language input (text or transcribed speech), excluding around 200 to 300 different signed languages [@un2022] and up to 70 million deaf people [@who2021;@wfd2022].

Throughout history, Deaf communities fought for the right to learn and use signed languages and for the public recognition of signed languages as legitimate ones.
Indeed, signed languages are sophisticated communication modalities, at least as capable as spoken languages in all aspects, both linguistic and social.
However, in a predominantly oral society, deaf people are constantly encouraged to use spoken languages through lip-reading or text-based communication.
The exclusion of signed languages from modern language technologies further suppresses signing in favor of spoken languages.
This exclusion disregards the preferences of the Deaf communities who strongly prefer to communicate in signed languages both online and for in-person day-to-day interactions,
among themselves and when interacting with spoken language communities [@padden1988deaf;@glickman2018language].
Thus, it is essential to make signed languages accessible.

To date, a large amount of research on Sign Language Processing (SLP) has been focused on the visual aspect of signed languages, led by the Computer Vision (CV) community, with little NLP involvement.
This focus is not unreasonable, given that a decade ago, we lacked adequate CV tools to process videos for further linguistic analyses.
However, similar to spoken languages, signed languages are fully-fledged systems exhibiting all the fundamental characteristics of natural languages,
and existing SLP techniques do not adequately address or leverage the linguistic structure of signed languages.
Signed languages introduce novel challenges for NLP due to their visual-gestural modality, simultaneity, spatial coherence, and lack of written form.
The lack of a written form makes the spoken language processing pipelines - which often start with audio transcription before processing -
incompatible with signed languages, forcing researchers to work directly on the raw video signal.

Furthermore, SLP is not only intellectually appealing but also an important research area with significant potential to benefit signing communities.
Beneficial applications enabled by signed language technologies include improved documentation of endangered sign languages;
educational tools for sign language learners; tools for query and retrieval of information from signed language videos; personal assistants that react to signed languages; real-time automatic sign language interpretations; and more.
Needless to say, in addressing this research area, researchers should work *alongside* and *under the direction of* deaf communities,
and to benefit the signing communities' interest above all [@harris2009research].

In this work, we describe the different representations used for sign language processing,
as well as survey the various tasks and recent advances on them.
We also make a comprehensive list of existing datasets and make the ones available easy to load using a simple and standardized interface.

### (Brief) History of Signed Languages and Deaf Culture

Throughout modern history,
spoken languages were dominant, so much so that signed languages struggled to be recognized as languages in their own right,
and educators developed misconceptions that signed language acquisition might hinder the development of speech skills.
For example, in 1880, a large international conference of deaf educators called the "Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf"
banned teaching signed languages, favoring speech therapy instead.
It was not until the seminal work on American Sign Language (ASL) by @writing:stokoe1960sign that signed languages started gaining
recognition as natural, independent, and well-defined languages, which inspired other researchers to further explore signed languages as a research area.
Nevertheless, antiquated attitudes that placed less importance on signed languages continue to inflict harm and subject many to linguistic neglect [@humphries2016avoiding].
Several studies have shown that deaf children raised solely with spoken languages do not gain enough access to a first language during their critical period of language acquisition [@murray2020importance].
This language deprivation can lead to life-long consequences on the cognitive, linguistic, socio-emotional, and academic development of the deaf [@hall2017language].

Signed languages are the primary languages of communication for the Deaf[^deaf] and are at the heart of Deaf communities.
In the past, the failure to recognize signed languages as fully-fledged natural language systems in their own right has had detrimental effects,
and in an increasingly digitized world, NLP research should strive to enable a world in which all people,
including the Deaf, have access to languages that fit their lived experience.

[^deaf]: When capitalized, "Deaf" refers to a community of deaf people who share a language and a culture, whereas the lowercase "deaf" refers to the audiological condition of not hearing. We follow the more recent convention of abandoning a distinction between "Deaf" and "deaf", using the latter term also to refer to (deaf) members of the sign language community [@napier-leeson-2016;@kusters-et-al-2017].

## Sign Language Linguistics Overview

Signed languages consist of phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic levels of structure that fulfill the same social, cognitive,
and communicative purposes as other natural languages.
While spoken languages primarily channel the oral-auditory modality, signed languages use the visual-gestural modality,
relying on the signer's face, hands, body, and space around them to create distinctions in meaning.
We present the linguistic features of signed languages[^asl-specific] that researchers must consider during their modeling.

[^asl-specific]: We mainly refer to ASL, where most sign language research has been conducted, but not exclusively.

###### Phonology {-}
Signs are composed of minimal units that combine manual features such as hand configuration,
palm orientation, placement, contact, path movement, local movement,
as well as non-manual features including eye aperture, head movement, and torso positioning [@liddell1989american;@johnson2011toward;@brentari2011sign;@sandler2012phonological].
Not all possible phonemes are realized in both signed and spoken languages, and inventories of two languages' phonemes/features may not overlap completely.
Different languages are also subject to rules for the allowed combinations of features.

###### Simultaneity {-}
Though an ASL sign takes about twice as long to produce than an English word,
the rates of transmission of information between the two languages are similar [@bellugi1972comparison].
One way signed languages compensate for the slower production rate of signs is through simultaneity:
Signed languages use multiple visual cues to convey different information simultaneously [@sandler2012phonological].
For example, the signer may produce the sign for "cup" on one hand while simultaneously pointing to the actual cup with the other to express "that cup."
Similarly to tone in spoken languages, the face and torso can convey additional affective information [@liddell2003grammar;@johnston2007australian].
Facial expressions can modify adjectives, adverbs, and verbs; a head shake can negate a phrase or sentence; eye direction can help indicate referents.

###### Referencing {-}
The signer can introduce referents in discourse either by pointing to their actual locations in space or by assigning a region in the signing space to a non-present referent and by pointing to this region to refer to it [@rathmann2011featural;@schembri2018indicating].
Signers can also establish relations between referents grounded in signing space by using directional signs or embodying the referents using body shift or eye gaze [@dudis2004body;@liddell1998gesture].
Spatial referencing also impact morphology when the directionality of a verb depends on the location of the reference to its subject and/or object [@de2008pointing;@fenlon2018modification]:
For example, a directional verb can move from its subject's location and end at its object's location.
While the relation between referents and verbs in spoken language is more arbitrary, referent relations are usually grounded in signed languages.
The visual space is heavily exploited to make referencing clear.

Another way anaphoric entities are referenced in sign language is by using classifiers or depicting signs [@supalla1986classifier;@wilcox2004rethinking;@roy2011discourse] that help describe the characteristics of the referent.
Classifiers are typically one-handed signs that do not have a particular location or movement assigned to them,
or derive features from meaningful discourse [@liddell2003grammar], so they can be used to convey how the referent relates to other entities,
describe its movement, and give more details.
For example, to tell about a car swerving and crashing, one might use the hand classifier for a vehicle, move it to indicate swerving, and crash it with another entity in space.

To quote someone other than oneself, signers perform *role shift* [@cormier2015rethinking],
where they may physically shift in space to mark the distinction and take on some characteristics of the people they represent.
For example, to recount a dialogue between a taller and a shorter person,
the signer may shift to one side and look up when taking the shorter person's role,
shift to the other side and look down when taking the taller person's role.

###### Fingerspelling {-}
Fingerspelling results from language contact between a signed language and a surrounding spoken language written form [@battison1978lexical;@wilcox1992phonetics;@brentari2001language;@patrie2011fingerspelled].
A set of manual gestures correspond with a written orthography or phonetic system.
This phenomenon, found in most signed languages, is often used to indicate names or places or new concepts from the spoken language but has often become integrated into the signed languages as another linguistic strategy [@padden1998asl;@montemurro2018emphatic].


## Sign Language Representations

Representation is a significant challenge for SLP.
Unlike spoken languages, signed languages have no widely adopted written form.
As signed languages are conveyed through the visual-gestural modality, video recording is the most straightforward way to capture them.
However, as videos include more information than needed for modeling and are expensive to record, store, and transmit,
a lower-dimensional representation has been sought after.

The following figure illustrates each signed language representation we will describe below.
In this demonstration, we deconstruct the video into its individual frames to exemplify the alignment of the annotations between the video and representations.

```{=html}

  \label{fig:continuous}
\end{figure*}
\end{landscape}
\restoregeometry
```

###### Videos {-}
are the most straightforward representation of a signed language and can amply incorporate the information conveyed through signing.
One major drawback of using videos is their high dimensionality:
They usually include more information than needed for modeling and are expensive to store, transmit, and encode.
As facial features are essential in sign, anonymizing raw videos remains an open problem,
limiting the possibility of making these videos publicly available [@isard2020approaches].

###### Skeletal Poses {-} 
reduce the visual cues in videos to skeleton-like wireframes or mesh representing the location of joints. 
This technique has been extensively used in the field of computer vision to estimate human pose from video data, 
where the goal is to determine the spatial configuration of the body at each point in time. 
Although high-quality pose estimation can be achieved using motion capture equipment, such methods are often expensive and intrusive. 
As a result, estimating pose from videos has become the preferred method in recent years [@pose:pishchulin2012articulated;@pose:chen2017adversarial;@pose:cao2018openpose;@pose:alp2018densepose].
Compared to video representations, accurate skeletal poses have a lower complexity and provide a semi-anonymized representation of the human body, while observing relatively low information loss. 
However, they remain a continuous, multidimensional representation that is not adapted to most NLP models.

###### Written notation systems {-}
represent signs as discrete visual features. Some systems are written linearly, and others use graphemes in two dimensions.
While various universal [@writing:sutton1990lessons;@writing:prillwitz1990hamburg] and language-specific notation systems [@writing:stokoe1960sign;@writing:kakumasu1968urubu;@writing:bergman1977tecknad] have been proposed,
no writing system has been adopted widely by any sign language community, and the lack of standards hinders the exchange and unification of resources and applications between projects.
The figure above depicts two universal notation systems:
SignWriting [@writing:sutton1990lessons], a two-dimensional pictographic system,
and HamNoSys [@writing:prillwitz1990hamburg], a linear stream of graphemes designed to be machine-readable.

###### Glosses {-}
are the transcription of signed languages sign-by-sign, with each sign having a unique semantic identifier. 
While various sign language corpus projects have provided guidelines for gloss annotation [@mesch2015gloss;@johnston2016auslan;@konrad2018public], 
a standardized gloss annotation protocol has yet to be established.
Linear gloss annotations have been criticized for their imprecise representation of signed language. 
These annotations fail to capture all the information expressed simultaneously through different cues, 
such as body posture, eye gaze, or spatial relations, leading to a loss of information that can significantly affect downstream performance on SLP tasks [@yin-read-2020-better;@muller-etal-2023-considerations].

@muller-etal-2023-considerations conduct an extensive review of the use of glosses in sign language translation research and make the following recommendations for research using glosses:

- Demonstrate awareness of limitations of gloss approaches and explicitly discuss them.
- Focus on datasets beyond RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T [@cihan2018neural]. 
Openly discuss the limited size and linguistic domain of this dataset.
- Use metrics that are well-established in MT.
If BLEU [@papineni-etal-2002-bleu] is used, compute it with SacreBLEU [@post-2018-call-sacrebleu], report metric signatures and disable internal tokenization for gloss outputs. 
Do not compare to scores produced with a different or unknown evaluation procedure.
- Given that glossing is corpus-specific, process glosses in a corpus-specific way, informed by transcription conventions.
- Optimize gloss translation baselines with methods shown to be effective for low-resource MT.


The following table additionally exemplifies the various representations for more isolated signs.
For this example, we use SignWriting as the notation system.
Note that the same sign might have two unrelated glosses, and the same gloss might have multiple valid spoken language translations.

## Tasks

So far, the computer vision community has primarily led the SLP research to focus on processing the visual features in signed language videos.
As a result, current SLP methods do not fully address the linguistic complexity of signed languages.
We survey common SLP tasks and current methods' limitations, drawing on signed languages' linguistic theories.

### Sign Language Detection

Sign language detection [@detection:borg2019sign;@detection:moryossef2020real;@detection:pal2023importance] is the binary classification task of determining whether signing activity is present in a given video frame.
A similar task in spoken languages is voice activity detection (VAD) [@sohn1999statistical;@ramirez2004efficient],
the detection of when a human voice is used in an audio signal.
As VAD methods often rely on speech-specific representations such as spectrograms, they are not necessarily applicable to videos.

@detection:borg2019sign introduced the classification of frames taken from YouTube videos as either signing or not signing. 
They took a spatial and temporal approach based on VGG-16 [@simonyan2015very] CNN to encode each frame 
and used a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [@cho2014learning] 
to encode the sequence of frames in a window of 20 frames at 5fps.
In addition to the raw frame, they either encoded optical-flow history, aggregated motion history, or frame difference.

@detection:moryossef2020real improved upon their method by performing sign language detection in real time.
They identified that sign language use involves movement of the body and, as such, designed a model that works on top of 
estimated human poses rather than directly on the video signal.
They calculated the optical flow norm of every joint detected on the body and applied a shallow yet effective contextualized model
to predict for every frame whether the person is signing or not.

While these recent detection models achieve high performance,
we need well-annotated data that include interference and distractions with non-signing instances for proper real-world evaluation. 
@detection:pal2023importance conducted a detailed analysis of the impact of signer overlap between the training and test sets 
on two sign detection benchmark datasets (Signing in the Wild [@detection:borg2019sign] and the DGS Corpus [@dataset:hanke-etal-2020-extending]) used by @detection:borg2019sign and @detection:moryossef2020real. 
By comparing the accuracy with and without overlap, they noticed a relative decrease in performance for signers not present during training. 
As a result, they suggested new dataset partitions that eliminate overlap between train and test sets and facilitate a more accurate evaluation of performance.

### Sign Language Identification

Sign language identification [@identification:gebre2013automatic;@identification:monteiro2016detecting] classifies which signed language is used in a given video.

@identification:gebre2013automatic found that a simple random-forest classifier utilizing the distribution of phonemes can distinguish between British Sign Language (BSL) and Greek Sign Language (ENN) with a 95% F1 score.
This finding is further supported by @identification:monteiro2016detecting, which, based on activity maps in signing space,
manages to differentiate between British Sign Language and
French Sign Language (Langue des Signes Française, LSF) with a 98% F1 score in videos with static backgrounds, 
and between American Sign Language and British Sign Language, with a 70% F1 score for videos mined from popular video-sharing sites. 
The authors attribute their success mainly to the different fingerspelling systems, which are two-handed in the case of BSL and one-handed in the case of ASL and LSF.

Although these pairwise classification results seem promising, better models would be needed for classifying from a large set of signed languages.
These methods only rely on low-level visual features,
while signed languages have several distinctive features on a linguistic level,
such as lexical or structural differences [@mckee2000lexical;@kimmelman2014information;@ferreira1984similarities;@shroyer1984signs] which have not been explored for this task.

### Sign Language Segmentation

Segmentation consists of detecting the frame boundaries for signs or phrases in videos to divide them into meaningful units.
While the most canonical way of dividing a spoken language text is into a linear sequence of words, 
due to the simultaneity of sign language, the notion of a sign language "word" is ill-defined, and sign language cannot be fully linearly modeled.

Current methods resort to segmenting units loosely mapped to signed language units [@segmentation:santemiz2009automatic;@segmentation:farag2019learning;@segmentation:bull2020automatic;@segmentation:renz2021signa;@segmentation:renz2021signb;@segmentation:bull2021aligning]
and do not explicitly leverage reliable linguistic predictors of sentence boundaries such as prosody in signed languages (i.e., pauses, extended sign duration, facial expressions) [@sandler2010prosody;@ormel2012prosodic]. 
@segmentation:de-sisto-etal-2021-defining call for a better understanding of sign language structure, which they believe is the necessary ground for the design and development of sign language recognition and segmentation methodologies.

@segmentation:santemiz2009automatic automatically extracted isolated signs from continuous signing by aligning the sequences obtained via speech recognition, 
modeled by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) approaches. 

@segmentation:farag2019learning used a random forest classifier to distinguish frames containing signs in Japanese Sign Language 
based on the composition of spatio-temporal angular and distance features between domain-specific pairs of joint segments.

@segmentation:bull2020automatic segmented French Sign Language into segments corresponding to subtitle units by relying on the alignment between subtitles and sign language videos, 
leveraging a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN; @Yu2017SpatioTemporalGC) with a BiLSTM on 2D skeleton data.

@segmentation:renz2021signa located temporal boundaries between signs in continuous sign language videos by employing 
3D convolutional neural network representations with iterative temporal segment refinement to resolve ambiguities between sign boundary cues. 
@segmentation:renz2021signb further proposed the Changepoint-Modulated Pseudo-Labelling (CMPL) algorithm to solve the problem of source-free domain adaptation. 

@segmentation:bull2021aligning presented a Transformer-based approach to segment sign language videos and align them with subtitles simultaneously, 
encoding subtitles by BERT [@devlin-etal-2019-bert] and videos by CNN video representations.

@segmentation:moryossef-etal-2023-linguistically presented a method motivated by linguistic cues observed in sign language corpora, such as prosody (pauses, pace, etc) and handshape changes. They also find that using BIO, an annotation scheme that notes the beginning, inside and outside, makes a significant difference over previous ones that only note IO (inside or outside). They find that including optical flow and 3D hand normalization helps with out-of-domain generalization and other signed languages as well. 

<!-- @segmentation:de-sisto-etal-2021-defining introduce a proposal for mapping segments to meaning in the form of an agglomerate of lexical and non-lexical information. -->


### Sign Language Recognition, Translation, and Production

Sign language translation (SLT) commonly refers to the translation of signed language to spoken language [@de2022machine;@muller-etal-2022-findings].
Sign language production is the reverse process of producing a sign language video from spoken language text.
Sign language recognition (SLR) [@adaloglou2020comprehensive] detects and labels signs from a video, either on isolated [@dataset:imashev2020dataset;@dataset:sincan2020autsl] or continuous [@cui2017recurrent;@cihan2018neural;@camgoz2020sign] signs.

In the following graph, we can see a fully connected pentagon where each node is a single data representation, 
and each directed edge represents the task of converting one data representation to another.

We split the graph into two: 

- Every edge to the left, on the orange background, represents a task in computer vision. These tasks are inherently language-agnostic; thus, they generalize between signed languages.
- Every edge to the right, on the blue background, represents a task in natural language processing. These tasks are sign language-specific, requiring a specific sign language lexicon or spoken language tokens.
- Every edge on both backgrounds represents a task requiring a combination of computer vision and natural language processing.

There are 20 tasks conceptually defined by this graph, with varying amounts of previous research.
Every path between two nodes might or might not be valid, depending on how lossy the tasks in the path are.

#### Video-to-Pose

Video-to-Pose—commonly known as pose estimation—is the task of detecting human figures in images and videos, 
so that one could determine, for example, where someone's elbow shows up in an image. 
It was shown that the face pose correlates with facial non-manual features like head direction [@vogler2005analysis].

This area has been thoroughly researched [@pose:pishchulin2012articulated;@pose:chen2017adversarial;@pose:cao2018openpose;@pose:alp2018densepose]
with objectives varying from predicting 2D / 3D poses to a selection of a small specific set of landmarks or a dense mesh of a person.

OpenPose [@pose:cao2018openpose;@pose:simon2017hand;@pose:cao2017realtime;@pose:wei2016cpm] is the first multi-person system to 
jointly detect human body, hand, facial, and foot keypoints (in total 135 keypoints) in 2D on single images.
While their model can estimate the full pose directly from an image in a single inference,
they also suggest a pipeline approach where they first estimate the body pose and then independently estimate
the hands and face pose by acquiring higher resolution crops around those areas.
Building on the slow pipeline approach, a single network whole body OpenPose model has been proposed [@pose:hidalgo2019singlenetwork],
which is faster and more accurate for the case of obtaining all keypoints.
With multiple recording angles, OpenPose also offers keypoint triangulation to reconstruct the pose in 3D.

DensePose [@pose:alp2018densepose] takes a different approach. 
Instead of classifying for every keypoint which pixel is most likely, they suggest a method similar to semantic segmentation,
for each pixel to classify which body part it belongs to.
Then, for each pixel, knowing the body part, they predict where that pixel is on the body part relative to a 2D projection of a representative body model.
This approach results in the reconstruction of the full-body mesh and allows sampling to find specific keypoints similar to OpenPose.

However, 2D human poses might not be sufficient to fully understand the position and orientation of landmarks in space,
and applying pose estimation per frame disregards video temporal movement information into account, 
especially in cases of rapid movement, which contain motion blur.

@pose:pavllo20193d developed two methods to convert between 2D poses to 3D poses. 
The first, a supervised method, was trained to use the temporal information between frames to predict the missing Z-axis. 
The second is an unsupervised method, leveraging the fact that the 2D poses are merely a projection of an unknown 3D pose 
and training a model to estimate the 3D pose and back-project to the input 2D poses. This back projection is a deterministic process, applying constraints on the 3D pose encoder. 
@pose:zelinka2020neural followed a similar process and added a constraint for bones to stay of a fixed length between frames.

@pose:panteleris2018using suggest converting the 2D poses to 3D using inverse kinematics (IK), a process taken from computer animation and robotics to calculate the variable joint parameters needed to place the end of a kinematic chain,
such as a robot manipulator or animation character's skeleton, in a given position and orientation relative to the start of the chain.
Demonstrating their approach to hand pose estimation, they manually explicitly encode the constraints and limits of each joint, resulting in 26 degrees of freedom. 
Then, non-linear least-squares minimization fits a 3D model of the hand to the estimated 2D joint positions, recovering the 3D hand pose.
This process is similar to the back-projection used by @pose:pavllo20193d, except here, no temporal information is being used.

MediaPipe Holistic [@mediapipe2020holistic] attempts to solve 3D pose estimation by taking a similar approach to OpenPose,
having a pipeline system to estimate the body, then the face and hands. Unlike OpenPose, the estimated poses are in 3D,
and the pose estimator runs in real-time on CPU, allowing for pose-based sign language models on low-powered mobile devices.
This pose estimation tool is widely available and built for Android, iOS, C++, Python, and the Web using JavaScript.

#### Pose-to-Video

Pose-to-Video, also known as motion transfer or skeletal animation in the field of robotics and animation, is the
conversion of a sequence of poses to a video.
This task is the final "rendering" of sign language in a visual modality.

@pose:chan2019everybody demonstrated a semi-supervised approach where they took a set of videos, 
ran pose estimation with OpenPose [@pose:cao2018openpose], and learned an image-to-image translation [@isola2017image]
between the rendered skeleton and the original video.
They demonstrated their approach on human dancing, extracting poses from a choreography
and rendering any person as if *they* were dancing.
They predicted two consecutive frames for temporally coherent video results and 
introduced a separate pipeline for a more realistic face synthesis, although still flawed.

@pose:wang2018vid2vid suggested a similar method using DensePose [@pose:alp2018densepose] representations 
in addition to the OpenPose [@pose:cao2018openpose] ones. 
They formalized a different model, with various objectives to optimize for, such as background-foreground separation and
temporal coherence by using the previous two timestamps in the input.

Using the method of @pose:chan2019everybody on "Everybody Dance Now", @pose:girocan2020slrtp asked, "Can Everybody Sign Now?" 
and investigated if people could understand sign language from automatically generated videos.
They conducted a study in which participants watched three types of videos: the original signing videos, 
videos showing only poses (skeletons), and reconstructed videos with realistic signing. 
The researchers evaluated the participants' understanding after watching each type of video.
Results revealed a preference for reconstructed videos over skeleton videos.
However, the standard video synthesis methods used in the study were not effective enough for clear sign language translation. 
Participants had trouble understanding the reconstructed videos, 
suggesting that improvements are needed for better sign language translation in the future.

As a direct response, @saunders2020everybody showed that like in @pose:chan2019everybody, 
where an adversarial loss was added to specifically generate the face, adding a similar loss to the hand generation process
yielded high-resolution, more photo-realistic continuous sign language videos.
To further improve the hand image synthesis quality, they introduced a keypoint-based loss function to avoid issues caused by motion blur. 

In a follow-up paper, @anonysign introduced the task of Sign Language Video Anonymisation (SLVA) 
as an automatic method to anonymize the visual appearance of a sign language video while 
retaining the original sign language content.
Using a conditional variational autoencoder framework, they first extracted pose information from the source video to remove the original signer appearance,
then generated a photo-realistic sign language video of a novel appearance from the pose sequence. 
The authors proposed a novel style loss that ensures style consistency in the anonymized sign language videos. 

##### Sign Language Avatars

###### JASigning {-}
 is a virtual signing system that generates sign language performances using virtual human characters. 
This system evolved from the earlier SiGMLSigning system, which was developed during the ViSiCAST [@bangham2000virtual;@elliott2000development] and eSIGN [@zwitserlood2004synthetic] projects, 
and later underwent further development as part of the Dicta-Sign project [@dataset:matthes2012dicta;@dataset:efthimiou2012sign].

Originally, JASigning relied on Java JNLP apps for standalone use and integration into web pages. 
However, this approach became outdated due to the lack of support for Java in modern browsers. 
Consequently, the more recent CWA Signing Avatars (CWASA) system was developed, which is based on HTML5, 
utilizing JavaScript and WebGL technologies.

SiGML (Signing Gesture Markup Language) [@elliott2004overview] is an XML application that enables the transcription of sign language gestures. 
SiGML builds on HamNoSys, and indeed, one variant of SiGML is essentially an encoding of HamNoSys manual features, 
accompanied by a representation of non-manual aspects. 
SiGML is the input notation used by the JASigning applications and web applets. 
A number of editing tools for SiGML are available, mostly produced by the University of Hamburg.

The system parses the English text into SiGML before mapping it onto a 3D signing avatar that can produce signing.
CWASA then uses a large database of pre-defined 3D signing avatar animations, which can be combined to form new sentences. 
The system includes a 3D editor, allowing users to create custom signing avatars and animations.

###### PAULA [@paula:davidson2006paula] {-}
is a computer-based sign language avatar, initially developed for teaching sign language to hearing adults. 
The avatar is a 3D model of a person with a sign vocabulary that is manually animated. 
It takes an ASL utterance as a stream of glosses, performs syntactic and morphological modifications, 
decides on the appropriate phonemes and timings, and combines the results into a 3D animation of the avatar. 
Over the years, several techniques were used to make the avatar look more realistic. 

Over the years, several advancements have been made to enhance the realism and expressiveness of the PAULA avatar, 
such as refining the eyebrow motion to appear more natural [@paula:wolfe2011linguistics], 
combining emotion and co-occurring facial nonmanual signals [@paula:schnepp2012combining;@paula:schnepp2013generating], 
improving smoothness while avoiding robotic movements [@paula:mcdonald2016automated], 
and facilitating simultaneity [@paula:mcdonald2017improved]. 
Other developments include interfacing with sign language notation systems like AZee [@paula:filhol2017synthesizing], 
enhancing mouthing animation [@paula:johnson2018improved;@paula:wolfe2022supporting], 
multi-layering facial textures and makeup [@paula:wolfecase], 
and applying adverbial modifiers [@paula:moncrief2020extending;@paula:moncrief2021generalizing]. 

Additional improvements to PAULA focus on making the avatar more lifelike by relaxing wrist orientations and other extreme "mathematical" angles [@paula:filhol2020synthesis], 
refining hand shape transition, relaxation, and collision [@paula:baowidan2021improving], 
implementing hierarchical phrase transitions [@paula:mcdonald2021natural], 
creating more realistic facial muscle control [@paula:mcdonald2022novel], 
and supporting geometric relocations [@paula:filhol2022representation].

###### SiMAX [@SiMAX2020SignLanguage] {-}

is a software application developed to transform textual input into 3D animated sign language representations.
Utilizing a comprehensive database and the expertise of deaf sign language professionals, SiMAX ensures accurate translations of both written and spoken content.
The process begins with the generation of a translation suggestion, which is subsequently reviewed and, if necessary, 
modified by deaf translators to ensure accuracy and cultural appropriateness.
These translations are carried out by a customizable digital avatar that can be adapted to reflect the corporate identity or target audience of the user.
This approach offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional sign language video production, as it eliminates 
the need for expensive film studios and complex video technology typically associated with such productions.



##### Image and Video Generation Models

Most recently in the field of image and video generation, 
there have been notable advances in methods such as 
Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks [@style-to-image:Karras2018ASG;@style-to-image:Karras2019stylegan2;@style-to-image:Karras2021], 
Variational Diffusion Models [@text-to-image:Kingma2021VariationalDM], 
High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models [@text-to-image:Rombach2021HighResolutionIS], 
High Definition Video Generation with Diffusion Models [@text-to-video:Ho2022ImagenVH], and 
High-Resolution Video Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models [@text-to-video:blattmann2023videoldm]. 
These methods have significantly improved image and video synthesis quality, 
providing stunningly realistic and visually appealing results.

However, despite their remarkable progress in generating high-quality images and videos, 
these models trade-off computational efficiency.
The complexity of these algorithms often results in slower inference times, 
making real-time applications challenging.
On-device deployment of these models provides benefits such as lower server costs, offline functionality, and improved user privacy.
While compute-aware optimizations, specifically targeting hardware capabilities of different devices, could
improve the inference latency of these models, @Chen2023SpeedIA found that optimizing such models on top-of-the-line mobile devices
such as the Samsung S23 Ultra or iPhone 14 Pro Max can decrease per-frame inference latency from around 23 seconds to around 12.

ControlNet [@pose-to-image:zhang2023adding] recently presented a neural network structure for controlling 
pretrained large diffusion models with additional input conditions. 
This approach enables end-to-end learning of task-specific conditions, even with a small training dataset. 
Training a ControlNet is as fast as fine-tuning a diffusion model and 
can be executed on personal devices or scaled to large amounts of data using powerful computation clusters. 
ControlNet has been demonstrated to augment large diffusion models like Stable Diffusion with conditional inputs such as edge maps, segmentation maps, and keypoints.
One of the applications of ControlNet is pose-to-image translation control, 
which allows the generation of images based on pose information. 
Although this method has shown promising results, it still requires retraining the model and does not inherently support temporal coherency, which is important for tasks like sign language translation.



In the near future, we can expect many works on controlling video diffusion models directly from text for sign language translation. 
These models will likely generate visually appealing and realistic videos. However, they may still make 
mistakes and be limited to scenarios with more training data available. 
Developing models that can accurately generate sign language videos from text or pose information while maintaining 
visual quality and temporal coherency will be essential for advancing the field of sign language production.

#### Pose-to-Gloss
Pose-to-Gloss, also known as sign language recognition, is the task of recognizing a sequence of signs from a sequence of poses.
Though some previous works have referred to this as "sign language translation," recognition merely determines the associated label of each sign,
without handling the syntax and morphology of the signed language [@padden1988interaction] to create a spoken language output.
Instead, SLR has often been used as an intermediate step during translation to produce glosses from signed language videos.

@jiang2021sign proposed a novel Skeleton Aware Multi-modal Framework with a Global Ensemble Model (GEM) for isolated SLR (SAM-SLR-v2) to learn and fuse multimodal feature representations. Specifically, they use a Sign Language Graph Convolution Network (SL-GCN) to model the embedded dynamics of skeleton keypoints and a Separable Spatial-Temporal Convolution Network (SSTCN) to exploit skeleton features. The proposed late-fusion GEM fuses the skeleton-based predictions with other RGB and depth-based modalities to provide global information and make an accurate SLR prediction.

@dafnis2022bidirectional work on the same modified WLASL dataset as @jiang2021sign, but do not require multimodal data input. Instead, they propose a bidirectional skeleton-based graph convolutional network framework with linguistically motivated parameters and attention to the start and end
frames of signs. They cooperatively use forward and backward data streams, including various sub-streams, as input. They also use pre-training to leverage transfer learning.

@selvaraj-etal-2022-openhands introduced an open-source [OpenHands](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/OpenHands) library, 
which consists of standardized pose datasets for different existing sign language datasets and trained checkpoints 
of four pose-based isolated sign language recognition models across six languages (American, Argentinian, Chinese, Greek, Indian, and Turkish). 
To address the lack of labeled data, they propose self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled data and curate the largest pose-based 
pretraining dataset on Indian Sign Language (Indian-SL). They established that pretraining is effective for sign language recognition by 
demonstrating improved fine-tuning performance especially in low-resource settings and high crosslingual transfer from Indian-SL to a few other sign languages.

The work of @kezar2023improving, based on the [OpenHands](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/OpenHands) library, 
explicitly recognizes the role of phonology to achieve more accurate isolated sign language recognition (ISLR). 
To allow additional predictions on phonological characteristics (such as handshape), 
they combine the phonological annotations in ASL-LEX 2.0 [@dataset:sehyr2021asl] with signs in the WLASL 2000 ISLR benchmark [@dataset:li2020word]. 
Interestingly, @tavella-etal-2022-wlasl construct a similar dataset aiming just for phonological property recognition in American Sign Language (ASL).

#### Gloss-to-Pose
Gloss-to-Pose, subsumed under the task of sign language production, is the task of producing a sequence of poses that adequately represent
a sequence of signs written as gloss.

To produce a sign language video, @stoll2018sign constructed a lookup table between glosses and sequences of 2D poses.
They aligned all pose sequences at the neck joint of a reference skeleton and grouped all sequences belonging to the same gloss.
Then, for each group, they applied dynamic time warping and averaged out all sequences in the group to construct the mean pose sequence.
This approach suffers from not having an accurate set of poses aligned to the gloss and from unnatural motion transitions between glosses.

To alleviate the downsides of the previous work, @stoll2020text2sign constructed a lookup table of gloss to a group of sequences of poses rather than creating a mean pose sequence.
They built a Motion Graph [@min2012motion], which is a Markov process used to generate new motion sequences that are representative of natural motion,
and selected the motion primitives (sequence of poses) per gloss with the highest transition probability.
To smooth that sequence and reduce unnatural motion, they used a Savitzky–Golay motion transition smoothing filter [@savitzky1964smoothing].
@moryossef2023baseline re-implemented their approach and made it open-source.

@huang2021towards used a new non-autoregressive model to generate a sequence of poses for a sequence of glosses. 
They argued that existing models like @saunders2020adversarial are prone to error accumulation and high inference latency due to their autoregressive nature. 
Their model performs gradual upsampling of the poses, by starting with a pose including only two joints in the first layer, and gradually introducing more keypoints.
They evaluated their model on the RWTH-PHOENIX-WEATHER 2014T dataset [@cihan2018neural] using 
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) [@Berndt1994UsingDT] to align the poses before computing Mean Joint Error (DTW-MJE).
They demonstrated that their model outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and speed, making it a promising approach for fast and high-quality sign language production.

---

#### Video-to-Gloss
Video-to-Gloss, also known as sign language recognition, is the task of recognizing a sequence of signs from a video.

For this recognition, @cui2017recurrent constructs a three-step optimization model.
First, they train a video-to-gloss end-to-end model, where they encode the video using a spatio-temporal CNN encoder
and predict the gloss using a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) [@graves2006connectionist].
Then, from the CTC alignment and category proposal, they encode each gloss-level segment independently, trained to predict the gloss category,
and use this gloss video segments encoding to optimize the sequence learning model.

@cihan2018neural fundamentally differ from that approach and formulate this problem as if it is a natural-language translation problem.
They encode each video frame using AlexNet [@krizhevsky2012imagenet], initialized using weights trained on ImageNet [@deng2009imagenet].
Then they apply a GRU encoder-decoder architecture with Luong Attention [@luong2015effective] to generate the gloss.
In follow-up work, @camgoz2020sign use a transformer encoder [@vaswani2017attention] to replace the GRU 
and use a CTC to decode the gloss. They show a slight improvement with this approach on the video-to-gloss task.

@adaloglou2020comprehensive perform a comparative experimental assessment of computer vision-based methods for the video-to-gloss task.
They implement various approaches from previous research [@camgoz2017subunets;@cui2019deep;@dataset:joze2018ms]
and test them on multiple datasets [@dataset:huang2018video;@cihan2018neural;@dataset:von2007towards;@dataset:joze2018ms]
either for isolated sign recognition or continuous sign recognition.
They conclude that 3D convolutional models outperform models using only recurrent networks to capture the temporal information,
and that these models are more scalable given the restricted receptive field, which results from the CNN "sliding window" technique.

@momeni2022automatic developed a comprehensive pipeline that combines various models to densely annotate sign language videos. 
By leveraging the use of synonyms and subtitle-signing alignment, their approach demonstrates the value of pseudo-labeling from a sign recognition model for sign spotting. 
They propose a novel method to increase annotations for both known and unknown classes, relying on in-domain exemplars. 
As a result, their framework significantly expands the number of confident automatic annotations on the 
BOBSL BSL sign language corpus [@dataset:albanie2021bobsl] from 670K to 5M, and they generously make these annotations publicly available.

```{=ignore}
<span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span> @camgoz2017subunets SubUNets
Camgoz et al. [26] introduce a DNN-based approach for
solving the simultaneous alignment and recognition problems,
typically called "sequence-to-sequence" learning. In
particular, the problem is decomposed by a series
of specialized systems called SubUNets. To solve the task, the goal
is to model the spatio-temporal relationships among these
SubUNets. More specifically, SubUNets allow to inject domain-specific expert knowledge into
the system regarding suitable intermediate representations.
Additionally, they also allow performing transfer-learning between different interrelated tasks implicitly.

<span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span> @cui2019deep GoogLeNet + TConvs
In contrast to other 2D CNN-based methods that employ
HMMs, Cui et al. [25] propose a model that includes an
extra temporal module (TConvs), after the feature extractor
(GoogLeNet). The TConvs module consists of two 1D CNN
layers and two max pooling layers. It is designed to capture the fine-grained dependencies inside a gloss (intra-gloss dependencies) between consecutive frames into compact per-window feature vectors. Finally, bidirectional RNNs are applied to capture the entire sentence's long-term temporal dependencies. The total architecture is trained iteratively to exploit the expressive capability of DNN models with limited data.

<span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span> @dataset:joze2018ms I3D
Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) [@carreira2017quo] was originally developed
for the task of human action recognition; however, its application has demonstrated outstanding performance on isolated SLR [42]. In particular, the I3D architecture is an
extended version of GoogLeNet, which contains several 3D
convolutional layers followed by 3D max-pooling layers. The
key insight of this architecture is the endowing of the 2D
sub-modules (filters and pooling kernels) with an additional
temporal dimension. This methodology makes learning spatio-temporal features from videos feasible while leveraging efficient known architecture designs and parameters.

<span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span> @pu2019iterative 3D ResNet+LSTM
Pu et al. [45] propose a framework comprising a 3D CNN
for feature extraction, an RNN for sequence learning, and
two different decoding strategies, one performed with CTC
and the other with an attentional decoder RNN. The glosses
predicted by the attentional decoder are utilized to draw a
warping path using a soft-DTW [47] alignment constraint.
The warping paths display the alignments between glosses
and video segments. The proposed pseudo-alignments are then
employed for iterative optimization.
```


#### Gloss-to-Video
Gloss-to-Video, also known as sign language production, is the task of producing a video that adequately represents
a sequence of signs written as gloss.

As of 2020, no research discusses the direct translation task between gloss and video.
This lack of discussion results from the computational impracticality of the desired model, 
leading researchers to refrain from performing this task directly and instead rely on pipeline approaches using intermediate pose representations.

---

#### Gloss-to-Text
Gloss-to-Text, also known as sign language translation, is the natural language processing task of translating
between gloss text representing sign language signs and spoken language text. 
These texts commonly differ in terminology, capitalization, and sentence structure.

@cihan2018neural experimented with various machine-translation architectures and compared using an LSTM [@hochreiter1997long] vs. GRU for the recurrent model,
as well as Luong attention [@luong2015effective] vs. Bahdanau attention [@bahdanau2014neural] and various batch sizes. 
They concluded that on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, which was also presented in this work, 
using GRUs, Luong attention, and a batch size of 1 outperforms all other configurations.

In parallel with the advancements in spoken language machine translation, 
@yin-read-2020-better proposed replacing the RNN with a Transformer [@vaswani2017attention] encoder-decoder model, showing improvements on both RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (DGS) and ASLG-PC12 (ASL) datasets both using a single model and ensemble of models.
Interestingly, in gloss-to-text, they show that using the sign language recognition (video-to-gloss) system output outperforms using the gold annotated glosses.

Building on the code published by @yin-read-2020-better, @moryossef-etal-2021-data show it is beneficial to pre-train these translation models
using augmented monolingual spoken language corpora.
They try three different approaches for data augmentation:
(1) Back-translation;
(2) General text-to-gloss rules, including lemmatization, word reordering, and dropping of words; 
(3) Language-pair-specific rules augmenting the spoken language syntax to its corresponding sign language syntax.
When pretraining, all augmentations show improvements over the baseline for RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (DGS) and NCSLGR (ASL).

#### Text-to-Gloss
Text-to-gloss, an instantiation of sign language translation, is the task of translating between a spoken language text and sign language glosses.
It is an appealing area of research because of its simplicity for integrating in existing NMT pipelines, 
despite recent works such as @yin-read-2020-better and @muller-etal-2023-considerations claim that glosses are an inefficient representation of sign language,
and that glosses are not a complete representation of signs [@pizzuto:06001:sign-lang:lrec].



@zhao2000machine used a Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG)-based system to translate English sentences to American Sign Language (ASL) gloss sequences.
They parsed the English text and simultaneously assembled an ASL gloss tree, using Synchronous TAGs [@shieber1990synchronous;@shieber1994restricting], 
by associating the ASL elementary trees with the English elementary trees and associating the nodes at which subsequent substitutions or adjunctions can occur.
Synchronous TAGs have been used for machine translation between spoken languages [@abeille1991using], but this was the first application to a signed language.

For the automatic translation of gloss-to-text, @dataset:othman2012english identified the need for a large parallel sign language gloss and spoken language text corpus.
They developed a part-of-speech-based grammar to transform English sentences from the Gutenberg Project ebooks collection [@lebert2008project] into American Sign Language gloss.
Their final corpus contains over 100 million synthetic sentences and 800 million words and is the most extensive English-ASL gloss corpus we know of.
Unfortunately, it is hard to attest to the quality of the corpus, as the authors did not evaluate their method on real English-ASL gloss pairs.

@egea-gomez-etal-2021-syntax presented a syntax-aware transformer for this task, 
by injecting word dependency tags to augment the embeddings inputted to the encoder. 
This involves minor modifications in the neural architecture leading to negligible impact on computational
complexity of the model.
Testing their model on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T [@cihan2018neural], 
they demonstrated that injecting this additional information results in better translation quality. 

---

#### Video-to-Text
Video-to-text, also known as sign language translation, is the task of translating a raw video to spoken language text.

@camgoz2020sign proposed a single architecture to perform this task that can use both the sign language gloss and 
the spoken language text in joint supervision.
They use the pre-trained spatial embeddings from @koller2019weakly to encode each frame independently and encode the frames with a transformer.
On this encoding, they use a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) [@graves2006connectionist] to classify the sign language gloss.
Using the same encoding, they use a transformer decoder to decode the spoken language text one token at a time.
They show that adding gloss supervision improves the model over not using it and that it outperforms previous video-to-gloss-to-text pipeline approaches [@cihan2018neural].

Following up, @camgoz2020multi propose a new architecture that does not require the supervision of glosses, named "Multi-channel Transformers for Multi-articulatory Sign Language Translation".
In this approach, they crop the signing hand and the face and perform 3D pose estimation to obtain three separate data channels.
They encode each data channel separately using a transformer, then encode all channels together and concatenate the separate channels for each frame.
Like their previous work, they use a transformer decoder to decode the spoken language text, but unlike their previous work,
do not use the gloss as additional supervision.
Instead, they add two "anchoring" losses to predict the hand shape and mouth shape from each frame independently, 
as silver annotations are available to them using the model proposed in @koller2019weakly.
They conclude that this approach is on-par with previous approaches requiring glosses, 
and so they have broken the dependency upon costly annotated gloss information in the video-to-text task.

@shi-etal-2022-open introduce OpenASL, a large-scale American Sign Language (ASL) - English dataset collected from online video sites (e.g., YouTube), and then propose a set of techniques including sign search as a pretext task for pre-training and fusion of mouthing and handshape features to improve translation quality in the absence of glosses and in the presence of visually challenging data.

<!-- Really should put MMTLB here, a number of papers cite it including chen2022, which actually builds on it directly, cites it as a source for "mBART is good for SLT", etc. -->

@chen2022TwoStreamNetworkSign present a two-stream network for sign language recognition (SLR) and translation (SLT), utilizing a dual visual encoder architecture to encode RGB video frames and pose keypoints in separate streams. 
These streams interact via bidirectional lateral connections. 
For SLT, the visual encoders based on an S3D backbone [@xie2018SpatiotemporalS3D] output to a multilingual translation network using mBART [@liu-etal-2020-multilingual-denoising]. 
The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014 [@koller2015ContinuousSLR], RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T [@cihan2018neural] and CSL-Daily [@dataset:Zhou2021_SignBackTranslation_CSLDaily] datasets.

@zhang2023sltunet propose a multi-modal, multi-task learning approach to end-to-end sign language translation. 
The model features shared representations for different modalities such as text and video and is trained jointly 
on several tasks such as video-to-gloss, gloss-to-text, and video-to-text. 
The approach allows leveraging external data such as parallel data for spoken language machine translation.

@Zhao_Zhang_Fu_Hu_Su_Chen_2024 introduce CV-SLT, employing conditional variational autoencoders to address the modality gap between video and text.
Their approach involves guiding the model to encode visual and textual data similarly through two paths: one with visual data alone and one with both modalities.
Using KL divergences, they steer the model towards generating consistent embeddings and accurate outputs regardless of the path.
Once the model achieves consistent performance across paths, it can be utilized for translation without gloss supervision.
Evaluation on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T [@cihan2018neural] and CSL-Daily [@dataset:Zhou2021_SignBackTranslation_CSLDaily] datasets demonstrates its efficacy.
They provide a [code implementation](https://github.com/rzhao-zhsq/CV-SLT) based largely on @chenSimpleMultiModalityTransfer2022a.
<!-- The CV-SLT code looks pretty nice! Conda env file, data prep, not too old, paths in .yaml files, checkpoints provided (including the ones for replication), commands to train and evaluate, very nice -->


<!-- <span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span>: the "previous gloss-free frameworks" that gongLLMsAreGood2024 cite are: Gloss Attention for Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (2023) and Gloss-free sign language translation: Improving from visual-language pretraining, 2023 aka GFSLT-VLP. Could be good to lead into it with explanations of those? -->

@gongLLMsAreGood2024 introduce SignLLM, a framework for gloss-free sign language translation that leverages the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs).
SignLLM converts sign videos into discrete and hierarchical representations compatible with LLMs through two modules: (1) The Vector-Quantized Visual Sign (VQ-Sign) module, which translates sign videos into discrete "character-level" tokens, and (2) the Codebook Reconstruction and Alignment (CRA) module, which restructures these tokens into "word-level" representations.
During inference, the "word-level" tokens are projected into the LLM's embedding space, which is then prompted for translation.
The LLM itself can be taken "off the shelf" and does not need to be trained.
In training, the VQ-Sign "character-level" module is trained with a context prediction task, the CRA "word-level" module with an optimal transport technique, and a sign-text alignment loss further enhances the semantic alignment between sign and text tokens.
The framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T [@cihan2018neural] and CSL-Daily [@dataset:Zhou2021_SignBackTranslation_CSLDaily] datasets without relying on gloss annotations.
<!-- <span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span>: c.f. SignLLM with https://github.com/sign-language-processing/sign-vq? -->

<!-- <span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span>: YoutubeASL explanation would fit nicely here before Rust et al 2024. They don't just do data IIRC. -->

@rust2024PrivacyAwareSign introduce a two-stage privacy-aware method for sign language translation (SLT) at scale, termed Self-Supervised Video Pretraining for Sign Language Translation (SSVP-SLT). 
The first stage involves self-supervised pretraining of a Hiera vision transformer [@ryali2023HieraVisionTransformer] on large unannotated video datasets [@dataset:duarte2020how2sign;@dataset:uthus2023YoutubeASL]. 
In the second stage, the vision model's outputs are fed into a multilingual language model [@raffel2020T5Transformer] for finetuning on the How2Sign dataset [@dataset:duarte2020how2sign].
To mitigate privacy risks, the framework employs facial blurring during pretraining.
They find that while pretraining with blurring hurts performance, some can be recovered when finetuning with unblurred data.
SSVP-SLT achieves state-of-the-art performance on How2Sign [@dataset:duarte2020how2sign].
They conclude that SLT models can be pretrained in a privacy-aware manner without sacrificing too much performance.
Additionally, the authors release DailyMoth-70h, a new 70-hour ASL dataset from [The Daily Moth](https://www.dailymoth.com/).

#### Text-to-Video
Text-to-Video, also known as sign language production, is the task of producing a video that adequately represents
a spoken language text in sign language.

As of 2020, no research discusses the direct translation task between text and video.
This lack of discussion results from the computational impracticality of the desired model,
leading researchers to refrain from performing this task directly and instead rely on pipeline approaches using intermediate pose representations.

---

#### Pose-to-Text
Pose-to-text, also known as sign language translation, is the task of translating a captured or estimated pose sequence to spoken language text.

@dataset:ko2019neural demonstrated impressive performance on the pose-to-text task by inputting the pose sequence into a
standard encoder-decoder translation network. 
They experimented both with GRU and various types of attention [@luong2015effective;@bahdanau2014neural] and with a Transformer [@vaswani2017attention],
and showed similar performance, with the transformer underperforming on the validation set and overperforming on the test set, which consists of unseen signers.
They experimented with various normalization schemes, mainly subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of every individual keypoint
either concerning the entire frame or the relevant "object" (Body, Face, and Hand).

#### Text-to-Pose
Text-to-Pose, also known as sign language production, is the task of producing a sequence of poses that adequately represent
a spoken language text in sign language, as an intermediate representation to overcome challenges in animation.
Most efforts use poses as an intermediate representation to overcome the challenges in generating videos directly, with the goal of using computer animation or pose-to-video models to perform video production.

@saunders2020progressive proposed Progressive Transformers, a model to translate from 
discrete spoken language sentences to continuous 3D sign pose sequences in an autoregressive manner.
Unlike symbolic transformers [@vaswani2017attention], which use a discrete vocabulary and thus can predict an end-of-sequence (`EOS`) token in every step, the progressive transformer predicts a 
$counter ∈ [0,1]$ in addition to the pose.
In inference time, $counter=1$ is considered the end of the sequence.
They tested their approach on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset [@cihan2018neural] using OpenPose 2D pose estimation,
uplifted to 3D [@pose:zelinka2020neural], and showed favorable results when evaluating using back-translation 
from the generated poses to spoken language.
They further showed [@saunders2020adversarial] that using an adversarial discriminator between 
the ground truth poses and the generated poses, conditioned on the input spoken language text, improves the production quality as measured using back-translation.

To overcome the issues of under-articulation seen in the above works, 
@saunders2020everybody expanded on the progressive transformer model using a 
Mixture Density Network (MDN) [@bishop1994mixture] to model the variation found in sign language.
While this model underperformed on the validation set, compared to previous work, it outperformed on the test set.

@pose:zelinka2020neural presented a similar autoregressive decoder approach, with added dynamic-time-warping (DTW) and soft attention.
They tested their approach on Czech Sign Language weather data extracted from the news, which is not manually annotated,
or aligned to the spoken language captions, and showed their DTW is advantageous for this kind of task.

@xiao2020skeleton closed the loop by proposing a text-to-pose-to-text model for the case of isolated sign language recognition.
They first trained a classifier to take a sequence of poses encoded by a BiLSTM and classify the relevant sign, then proposed a production system to take a single sign and sample a constant length sequence of 50 poses from a Gaussian Mixture Model.
These components are combined such that given a sign class $y$, a pose sequence is generated, then classified back into a sign class $ŷ$,
and the loss is applied between $y$ and $ŷ$, and not directly on the generated pose sequence.
They evaluate their approach on the CSL dataset [@dataset:huang2018video] and show that their generated pose sequences 
almost reach the same classification performance as the reference sequences.

Due to the need for more suitable automatic evaluation methods for generated signs, existing works resort to measuring back-translation quality, which cannot accurately capture the quality of the produced signs nor their usability in real-world settings.
Understanding how distinctions in meaning are created in signed language may help develop a better evaluation method.

#### Notation-to-Text
@jiang2022machine explore text-to-text sign to spoken language translation, with SignWriting as the chosen sign language notation system. 
Despite SignWriting usually represented in 2D, they use the 1D Formal SignWriting specification and propose a neural factored machine translation approach to encode sequences of SignWriting graphemes as well as their positions in the 2D space. 
They verify the proposed approach on the SignBank dataset in both a bilingual setup (American Sign Language to English) and two multilingual setups (4 and 21 language pairs, respectively). 
They apply several low-resource machine translation techniques used to improve spoken language translation to similarly improve the performance of sign language translation. 
Their findings validate the use of an intermediate text representation for signed language translation, and pave the way for including sign language translation in natural language processing research.

#### Text-to-Notation

@jiang2022machine also explore the reverse translation direction, i.e., text to SignWriting translation. 
They conduct experiments under a same condition of their multilingual SignWriting to text (4 language pairs) experiment, and again propose a neural factored machine translation approach to decode the graphemes and their position separately. 
They borrow BLEU from spoken language translation to evaluate the predicted graphemes and mean absolute error to evaluate the positional numbers.

@walsh2022changing explore Text to HamNoSys (T2H) translation, with HamNoSys as the target sign language notation system. They experiment with direct T2H and Text to Gloss to HamNoSys (T2G2H) on a subset of the data from the MEINE DGS dataset [@dataset:hanke-etal-2020-extending], where all glosses are mapped to HamNoSys by a dictionary lookup. They find that direct T2H translation results in higher BLEU (it still needs to be clarified how well BLEU represents the quality of HamNoSys translations, though). They encode HamNoSys with BPE [@sennrich-etal-2016-neural], outperforming character-level and word-level tokenization. They also leverage BERT to create better sentence-level embeddings and use HamNoSys to extract the hand shapes of a sign as additional supervision during training.

---

#### Notation-to-Pose

@shalev2022ham2pose proposed Ham2Pose, a model to animate HamNoSys into a sequence of poses.
They first encode the HamNoSys into a meaningful "context" representation using a transform encoder, 
and use it to predict the length of the pose sequence to be generated.
Then, starting from a still frame they used an iterative non-autoregressive decoder to gradually refine the sign over $T$ steps,
In each time step $t$ from $T$ to $1$, the model predicts the required change from step $t$ to step $t-1$. After $T$ steps, the pose generator outputs the final pose sequence.
Their model outperformed previous methods like @saunders2020progressive, animating HamNoSys into more realistic sign language sequences.

#### Evaluation Metrics

Methods for automatic evaluation of sign language processing are typically dependent only on the output and independent of the input.

##### Text output

For tasks that output spoken language text, standard machine translation metrics such as BLEU, chrF, or COMET are commonly used.
<!-- <span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span>: examples -->

##### Gloss Output

Gloss outputs can be automatically scored as well, though not without issues.
In particular, @muller-etal-2023-considerations analysed this and provide a series of recommendations (see the section on "Glosses", above).

##### Pose Output

For translation from spoken languages to signed languages, automatic evaluation metrics are an open line of research, though some metrics involving back-translation have been developed (see Text-to-Pose and Notation-to-Pose, above).
<!-- <span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span>: "Progressive Transformers for End-to-End Sign Language Production" is the one cited in Towards Fast and High-Quality Sign Language Production as a "widely-used setting" for backtranslation. -->
<!-- <span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span>: Towards Fast and High-Quality Sign Language Production uses back-translation. Discuss results and issues. -->

<!-- These three papers are cited in @shalev2022ham2pose as previous work using APE -->
Naively, works in this domain have used metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Average Position Error (APE) for pose outputs [ahuja2019Language2PoseNaturalLanguage;ghosh2021SynthesisCompositionalAnimations;petrovich2022TEMOSGeneratingDiverse].
However, these metrics have significant limitations for Sign Language Production.

For example, MSE and APE do not account for variations in sequence length.
In practice, the same sign will not always take exactly the same amount of time to produce, even by the same signer.
To address time variation, @huang2021towards introduced a metric for pose sequence outputs based on measuring the distance between generated and reference pose sequences at the joint level using dynamic time warping, termed DTW-MJE (Dynamic Time Warping - Mean Joint Error).
However, this metric did not clearly address how to handle missing keypoints.
@shalev2022ham2pose experimented with multiple evaluation methods, and proposed adding a distance function that accounts for these missing keypoints.
They applied this function with normalization of keypoints, naming their metric nDTW-MJE.
<!-- They don't explicitly explain that the lowercase n is for "normalized keypoints" but that's my guess. -Colin -->

##### Multi-Channel Block output

As an alternative to gloss sequences, @kim-etal-2024-signbleu-automatic proposed a multi-channel output representation for sign languages and introduced SignBLEU, a BLEU-like scoring method for these outputs.
Instead of a single linear sequence of glosses, the representation segments sign language output into multiple linear channels, each containing discrete "blocks".
These blocks represent both manual and non-manual signals, for example, one for each hand and others for various non-manual signals like eyebrow movements.
The blocks are then converted to n-grams: temporal grams capture sequences within a channel, and channel grams capture co-occurrences across channels.
The SignBLEU score is then calculated for these n-grams of varying orders.
They evaluated SignBLEU on the DGS Corpus v3.0 [@dataset:Konrad_2020_dgscorpus_3; @dataset:prillwitz2008dgs], NIASL2021 [@dataset:huerta-enochian-etal-2022-kosign], and NCSLGR [@dataset:Neidle_2020_NCSLGR_ISLRN; @Vogler2012ASLLRP_data_access_interface] datasets, comparing it with single-channel (gloss) metrics such as BLEU, TER, chrF, and METEOR, as well as human evaluations by native signers.
The authors found that SignBLEU consistently correlated better to human evaluation than these alternatives.
However, one limitation of this approach is the lack of suitable datasets.
The authors reviewed a number of sign language corpora, noting the relative scarcity of multi-channel annotations.
The [source code for SignBLEU](https://github.com/eq4all-projects/SignBLEU) is available.
As with SacreBLEU [@post-2018-call-sacrebleu], the code can generate "version signature" strings summarizing key parameters, to enhance reproducibility.

<!-- (and SignBLEU can be installed and run! https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mRCSBQSvjkoSOz5MFiOko1CgtamuCVYO?usp=sharing) -->

### Sign Language Retrieval

Sign Language Retrieval is the task of finding a particular data item, given some input. In contrast to translation, generation or production tasks, there can exist a correct corresponding piece of data already, and the task is to find it out of many, if it exists. Metrics used include retrieval at Rank K (R@K, higher is better) and median rank (MedR, lower is better).

<!-- <span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span>: text-to-sign-video (T2V) section, sign-video-to-text (V2T) retrieval? -->
@athitsos2010LargeLexiconIndexingRetrieval present one of the early works on this task, using a method based on hand centroids and dynamic time warping to enable users to submit videos of a sign and thus query within the ASL Lexicon Video Dataset [@dataset:athitsos2008american].

@Zhang2010RevisedEditDistanceSignVideoRetrieval provide another early method for video-based querying.
They use classical image feature extraction methods to calculate movement trajectories.
They then use modified string edit distances between these trajectories as a way to find similar videos.

<!-- <span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span>: write here about SPOT-ALIGN aka Duarte2022SignVideoRetrivalWithTextQueries. Cheng2023CiCoSignLanguageRetrieval say retrival is "recently introduced... by SPOT-ALIGN" and cite Amanda Duarte, Samuel Albanie, Xavier Gir ́ o-i Nieto, and G ̈ ul Varol. Sign language video retrieval with free-form textual queries. Also Sign language video retrieval with free-form textual queries was the only other paper that Cheng2023CiCoSignLanguageRetrieval compared with. -->

<!-- <span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span>: write here also about jui-etal-2022-machine, the other paper cited by Cheng2023CiCoSignLanguageRetrieval for "Previous methods [16, 18] have demonstrated the feasibility of transferring a sign encoder pre-trained on large-scale sign-spotting data into downstream tasks." -->

@costerQueryingSignLanguage2023 present a method to query sign language dictionaries using dense vector search.
They pretrain a [Sign Language Recognition model](#pose-to-gloss) on a subset of the VGT corpus [@dataset:herreweghe2015VGTCorpus] to embed sign inputs.
Once the encoder is trained, they use it to generate embeddings for all dictionary signs.
When a user submits a query video, the system compares the input embeddings with those of the dictionary entries using Euclidean distance.
Tests on a [proof-of-concept Flemish Sign Language dictionary](https://github.com/m-decoster/VGT-SL-Dictionary) show that the system can successfully retrieve a limited vocabulary of signs, including some not in the training set.

@Cheng2023CiCoSignLanguageRetrieval introduce a video-to-text and text-to-video retrieval method using cross-lingual contrastive learning.
Inspired by transfer learning from sign-spotting/segmentation models [@jui-etal-2022-machine;@Duarte2022SignVideoRetrivalWithTextQueries], the authors employ a "domain-agnostic" I3D encoder, pretrained on large-scale sign language datasets for the sign-spotting task [@Varol2021ReadAndAttend].
On target datasets with continuous signing videos, they use this model with a sliding window to identify high confidence predictions, which are then used to finetune a "domain-aware" sign-spotting encoder.
The two encoders each pre-extract features from videos, which are then fused via a weighted sum.
Cross-lingual contrastive learning [@Radford2021LearningTV] is then applied to align the extracted features with paired texts within a shared embedding space.
This allows the calculation of similarity scores between text and video embeddings, and thus retrieval in either direction.
Evaluations on the How2Sign [@dataset:duarte2020how2sign] and RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T [@cihan2018neural] datasets demonstrate improvement over the previous state-of-the-art [@Duarte2022SignVideoRetrivalWithTextQueries].
Baseline retrieval results are also provided for the CSL-Daily dataset [@dataset:Zhou2021_SignBackTranslation_CSLDaily].

### Fingerspelling

Fingerspelling is spelling a word letter-by-letter, borrowing from the spoken language alphabet [@battison1978lexical;@wilcox1992phonetics;@brentari2001language;@patrie2011fingerspelled].
This phenomenon, found in most signed languages, often occurs when there is no previously agreed-upon sign for a concept,
like in technical language, colloquial conversations involving names, conversations involving current events,
emphatic forms, and the context of code-switching between the signed language and the corresponding spoken language [@padden1998asl;@montemurro2018emphatic].
The relative amount of fingerspelling varies between signed languages, and for American Sign Language (ASL), accounts for 12-35% of the signed content [@padden2003alphabet].

@patrie2011fingerspelled described the following terminology to describe three different forms of fingerspelling:

- **Careful**—slower spelling where each letter pose is clearly formed.
- **Rapid**—quick spelling where letters are often not completed and contain remnants of other letters in the word.
- **Lexicalized**—a sign produced by often using no more than two letter-hand-shapes [@battison1978lexical].<br>
For example, lexicalized `ALL` uses `A` and `L`, lexicalized `BUZZ` uses `B` and `Z`, etc...

#### Recognition
Fingerspelling recognition, a sub-task of sign language recognition, is the task of recognizing fingerspelled words from a sign language video.

@dataset:fs18slt introduced a large dataset available for American Sign Language fingerspelling recognition.
This dataset includes both the "careful" and "rapid" forms of fingerspelling collected from naturally occurring videos "in the wild", which are more challenging than studio conditions.
They trained a baseline model to take a sequence of images cropped around the signing hand and either use an autoregressive decoder or a CTC.
They found that the CTC outperformed the autoregressive decoder model, but both achieved poor recognition rates (35-41% character level accuracy) compared to human performance (around 82%).

In follow-up work, @dataset:fs18iccv collected nearly an order-of-magnitude larger dataset and designed a new recognition model.
Instead of detecting the signing hand, they detected the face and cropped a large area around it. 
Then, they performed an iterative process of zooming in to the hand using visual attention to retain sufficient information in high resolution of the hand.
Finally, like their previous work, they encoded the image hand crops sequence and used a CTC to obtain the frame labels.
They showed that this method outperformed their original "hand crop" method by 4% and that they could achieve up to 62.3% character-level accuracy using the additional data collected.
Looking through this dataset, we note that the videos in the dataset were taken from longer videos, and as they were cut, they did not retain the signing before the fingerspelling.
This context relates to language modeling, where at first, one fingerspells a word carefully, and when repeating it, might fingerspell it rapidly, 
but the interlocutors can infer they are fingerspelling the same word.

#### Production

Fingerspelling production, a sub-task of sign language production, is the task of producing a fingerspelling video for words.

In its basic form, "careful" fingerspelling production can be trivially solved using pre-defined letter handshapes interpolation.
@adeline2013fingerspell demonstrated this approach for American Sign Language and English fingerspelling.
They rigged a hand armature for each letter in the English alphabet ($N=26$) and generated all ($N^2=676$) transitions between every two letters using interpolation or manual animation.
Then, to fingerspell entire words, they chain pairs of letter transitions.
For example, for the word "CHLOE", they would chain the following transitions sequentially: `#C` `CH` `HL` `LO` `OE` `E#`.

However, to produce life-like animations, one must also consider the rhythm and speed of holding letters, and transitioning between letters,
as those can affect how intelligible fingerspelling motions are to an interlocutor (@wilcox1992phonetics).
@wheatland2016analysis analyzed both "careful" and "rapid" fingerspelling videos for these features.
They found that for both forms of fingerspelling, on average, the longer the word, the shorter the transition and hold time.
Furthermore, they found that less time is spent on middle letters on average, and the last letter is held on average for longer than the other letters in the word.
Finally, they used this information to construct an animation system using letter pose interpolation and controlled the timing using a data-driven statistical model.

### Pretraining and Representation-learning

<!-- SignBERT, SignBERT+, BEST. Possibly also Sign-VQ or CV-SLT can be discussed here -->

In this paradigm, rather than targeting a specific task (e.g. pose-to-text), the aim is to learn a generally-useful Sign Language Understanding model or representation which can be applied or finetuned to specific downstream tasks.

@hu2023SignBertPlus introduce SignBERT+, a self-supervised pretraining method for sign language understanding (SLU) based on masked modeling of pose sequences.
This is an extension of their earlier SignBERT [@hu2021SignBert], with several improvements.
For pretraining they extract pose sequences from over 230k videos using MMPose [@mmpose2020].
They then perform multi-level masked modeling (joints, frames, clips) on these sequences, integrating a statistical hand model [@romero2017MANOHandModel] to constrain the decoder's predictions for anatomical realism and enhanced accuracy.
Validation on isolated SLR (MS-ASL [@dataset:joze2018ms], WLASL [@dataset:li2020word], SLR500 [@huang2019attention3DCNNsSLR]), continuous SLR (RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 [@koller2015ContinuousSLR]), and SLT (RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T [@cihan2018neural]) demonstrates state-of-the-art performance.

<!-- BEST seems to be **B**ERT pre-training for **S**ign language recognition with coupling **T**okenization -->
@Zhao2023BESTPretrainingSignLanguageRecognition introduce BEST (BERT Pre-training for Sign Language Recognition with Coupling Tokenization), a pre-training method based on masked modeling of pose sequences using a coupled tokenization scheme.
This method takes pose triplet units (left hand, right hand, and upper-body with arms) as inputs, each tokenized into discrete codes [@van_den_Oord_2017NeuralDiscreteRepresentationLearning] that are then coupled together.
Masked modeling is then applied, where any or all components of the triplet (left hand, right hand, or upper-body) may be masked, to learn hierarchical correlations among them.
Unlike @hu2023SignBertPlus, BEST does not mask multi-frame pose sequences or individual joints.
The authors validate their pre-training method on isolated sign recognition (ISR) tasks using MS-ASL [@dataset:joze2018ms], WLASL [@dataset:li2020word], SLR500 [@huang2019attention3DCNNsSLR], and NMFs-CSL [@hu2021NMFAwareSLR].
Besides pose-to-gloss, they also experiment with video-to-gloss tasks via fusion with I3D [@carreira2017quo].
Results on these datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to previous methods and are comparable to those of SignBERT+ [@hu2023SignBertPlus].

## Resources

###### Dataset Papers

Research papers which do not necessarily contribute new theory or architectures are actually important and useful enablers of other research. Furthermore, the advancement of the dataset creation process itself is important, and the pipeline of creation and curation is a potential target for improvements and advancements.

@dataset:joshi-etal-2023-isltranslate introduce ISLTranslate, a large translation dataset for Indian Sign Language based on publicly available educational videos intended for hard-of-hearing children, which happen to contain both Indian Sign Language and English audio voiceover conveying the same content. They use a speech-to-text model to transcribe the audio content, which they later manually corrected with the help of accompanying books also containing the same content. They also use MediaPipe to extract pose features, and have a certified ISL signer validate a small portion of the sign-text pairs. They provide a baseline based on the architecture proposed in @camgoz2020sign, and provide code.

<!-- <span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span>: LSA-T aka dataset:dal2022lsa, they use AlphaPose "with the Halpe full-body keypoints format", a visualizer tool, and a baseline SLT model. Especially might be good to mention FiftyOne https://docs.voxel51.com/, "which
provides useful features such as allowing to filter samples by label, video, playlist,
or by the confidence score of the signer inference." -->

###### Bilingual dictionaries {-}
for signed language [@dataset:mesch2012meaning;@fenlon2015building;@crasborn2016ngt;@dataset:gutierrez2016lse] map a spoken language word or short phrase to a signed language video.
One notable dictionary, SpreadTheSign\footnote{\url{https://www.spreadthesign.com/}} is a parallel dictionary containing around 25,000 words with up to 42 different spoken-signed language pairs and more than 600,000 videos in total. Unfortunately, while dictionaries may help create lexical rules between languages, they do not demonstrate the grammar or the usage of signs in context.

###### Fingerspelling corpora {-}
usually consist of videos of words borrowed from spoken languages that are signed letter-by-letter. They can be synthetically created [@dataset:dreuw2006modeling] or mined from online resources [@dataset:fs18slt;@dataset:fs18iccv]. However, they only capture one aspect of signed languages.

###### Isolated sign corpora {-}
are collections of annotated single signs. They are synthesized [@dataset:ebling2018smile;@dataset:huang2018video;@dataset:sincan2020autsl;@dataset:hassan-etal-2020-isolated] or mined from online resources [@dataset:joze2018ms;@dataset:li2020word], and can be used for isolated sign language recognition or contrastive analysis of minimal signing pairs [@dataset:imashev2020dataset]. However, like dictionaries, they do not describe relations between signs, nor do they capture coarticulation during the signing, and are often limited in vocabulary size (20-1000 signs).

###### Continuous sign corpora {-}
contain parallel sequences of signs and spoken language.
Available continuous sign corpora are extremely limited, containing 4-6 orders of magnitude fewer sentence pairs than similar corpora for spoken language machine translation [@arivazhagan2019massively].
Moreover, while automatic speech recognition (ASR) datasets contain up to 50,000 hours of recordings [@pratap2020mls], the most extensive continuous sign language corpus contains only 1,150 hours, and only 50 of them are publicly available [@dataset:hanke-etal-2020-extending].
These datasets are usually synthesized [@dataset:databases2007volumes;@dataset:Crasborn2008TheCN;@dataset:ko2019neural;@dataset:hanke-etal-2020-extending] or recorded in studio conditions [@dataset:forster2014extensions;@cihan2018neural], which does not account for noise in real-life conditions. Moreover, some contain signed interpretations of spoken language rather than naturally-produced signs, which may not accurately represent native signing since translation is now a part of the discourse event.


###### Availability {-}
Unlike the vast amount and diversity of available spoken language resources that allow various applications,
sign language resources are scarce and, currently only support translation and production.
Unfortunately, most of the sign language corpora discussed in the literature are either not available for use or available under heavy restrictions and licensing terms. 
Furthermore, sign language data is especially challenging to anonymize due to the importance of facial and other physical features in signing videos, limiting its open distribution. Developing anonymization with minimal information loss or accurate anonymous representations is a promising research direction.

<!-- <span style="background-color: red; color: white; padding: 0 2px !important;">**TODO**</span>: a discussion on anonymization methods, including the thoughts of @rust2024PrivacyAwareSign, who mention a few approaches and cite them. They also argue that poses "do not offer meaningful privacy protection either" (Appendix A).  -->

### Collect Real-World Data

Data is essential to develop any of the core NLP tools previously described, and current efforts in SLP are often limited by the lack of adequate data. We discuss the considerations to keep in mind when building datasets, the challenges of collecting such data, and directions to facilitate data collection.

###### What is Good Signed Language Data? {-}
For SLP models to be deployable, they must be developed using data that represents the real world accurately. What constitutes an ideal signed language dataset is an open question,
we suggest including the following requirements:
(1) a broad domain; (2) sufficient data and vocabulary size; (3) real-world conditions; (4) naturally produced signs; (5) a diverse signer demographic; (6) native signers; and when applicable, (7) dense annotations.

To illustrate the importance of data quality during modeling, @yin-etal-2021-including first take as an example a current benchmark for SLP, the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset [@cihan2018neural] of German Sign Language, that does not meet most of the above criteria: it is restricted to the weather domain (1); contains only around 8K segments with 1K unique signs (2); filmed in studio conditions (3); interpreted from German utterances (4); and signed by nine Caucasian interpreters (5,6).
Although this dataset successfully addressed data scarcity issues at the time and successfully rendered results comparable and fueled competitive research, it does not accurately represent signed languages in the real world. On the other hand, the Public DGS Corpus [@dataset:hanke-etal-2020-extending] is an open-domain (1) dataset consisting of 50 hours of natural signing (4) by 330 native signers from various regions in Germany (5,6), annotated with glosses, HamNoSys and German translations (7), meeting all but two requirements we suggest.

They train a gloss-to-text sign language translation transformer [@yin-read-2020-better] on both datasets. On RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T, they obtain **22.17** BLEU on testing; on Public DGS Corpus, they obtain a mere \textbf{3.2} BLEU. Although Transformers achieve encouraging results on RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T [@saunders2020progressive;@camgoz2020multi], they fail on more realistic, open-domain data.
These results reveal that, for real-world applications, we need more data to train such models. At the same time, available data is severely limited in size; less data-hungry and more linguistically-informed approaches may be more suitable.
This experiment reveals how it is crucial to use data that accurately represent the complexity and diversity of signed languages to precisely assess what types of methods are suitable and how well our models would deploy to the real world.

###### Challenges of Data Collection {-}
Collecting and annotating signed data in line with the ideal requires more resources than speech or text data, taking up to 600 minutes per minute of an annotated signed language video [@dataset:hanke-etal-2020-extending]. Moreover, annotation usually requires specific knowledge and skills, which makes recruiting or training qualified annotators challenging. Additionally, there is little existing signed language data in the wild openly licensed for use, especially from native signers that are not interpretations of speech.
Therefore, data collection often requires significant efforts and costs of on-site recording.

###### Automating Annotation {-}
One helpful research direction for collecting more data that enables the development of deployable SLP models is creating tools that can simplify or automate parts of the collection and annotation process. One of the most significant bottlenecks in obtaining more adequate signed language data is the time and scarcity of experts required to perform annotation. Therefore, tools that perform automatic parsing, detection of frame boundaries, extraction of articulatory features, suggestions for lexical annotations, and allow parts of the annotation process to be crowdsourced to non-experts, to name a few, have a high potential to facilitate and accelerate the availability of good data.

### Practice Deaf Collaboration

Finally, when working with signed languages, it is vital to keep in mind \emph{who} this technology should benefit and \emph{what} they need.
Researchers in SLP should acknowledge that signed languages belong to the Deaf community and avoid exploiting their language as a commodity [@bird-2020-decolonising].

###### Solving Real Needs {-}

Many efforts in SLP have developed intrusive methods (e.g., requiring signers to wear special gloves), which are often rejected by signing communities and therefore have limited real-world value.
Such efforts are often marketed to perform "sign language translation" when they, in fact, only identify fingerspelling or recognize a minimal set of isolated signs at best. These approaches oversimplify the rich grammar of signed languages, promote the misconception that signs are solely expressed through the hands, and are considered by the Deaf community as a manifestation of audism, where it is the signers who must make the extra effort to wear additional sensors to be understood by non-signers [@erard2017sign]. To avoid such mistakes, we encourage close Deaf involvement throughout the research process to ensure that we direct our efforts toward applications that will be adopted by signers and do not make false assumptions about signed languages or the needs of signing communities.

###### Building Collaboration {-}
Deaf collaborations and leadership are essential for developing signed language technologies to ensure they address the community's needs and will be adopted, not relying on misconceptions or inaccuracies about signed language [@harris2009research;@kusters2017innovations].
Hearing researchers cannot relate to the deaf experience or fully understand the context in which the tools being developed would be used, nor can they speak for the deaf. Therefore, we encourage creating a long-term collaborative environment between signed language researchers and users so that deaf users can identify meaningful challenges and provide insights on the considerations to take while researchers cater to the signers' needs as the field evolves. We also recommend reaching out to signing communities for reviewing papers on signed languages to ensure an adequate evaluation of this type of research results published at academic venues. There are several ways to connect with Deaf communities for collaboration: one can seek deaf students in their local community, reach out to schools for the deaf, contact deaf linguists, join a network of researchers of sign-related technologies\footnote{\url{https://www.crest-network.com/}}, and/or participate in deaf-led projects.


### Downloading

Currently, there is no easy way or agreed-upon format to download and load sign language datasets, and as such, evaluation of these datasets is scarce.
As part of this work, we streamlined the loading of available datasets using [Tensorflow Datasets](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets) [@TFDS].
This tool allows researchers to load large and small datasets alike with a simple command and be comparable to other works.
We make these datasets available using a custom library, [Sign Language Datasets](https://github.com/sign-language-processing/datasets) [@moryossef2021datasets].

```python
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
import sign_language_datasets.datasets

# Loading a dataset with default configuration
aslg_pc12 = tfds.load("aslg_pc12")

# Loading a dataset with custom configuration
from sign_language_datasets.datasets.config import SignDatasetConfig

config = SignDatasetConfig(
    name="videos_and_poses256x256:12",
    # Specific version
    version="3.0.0",
    # Download, and load dataset videos
    include_video=True,
    # Load videos at constant, 12 fps
    fps=12,
    # Convert videos to a constant resolution, 256x256
    resolution=(256, 256),
    # Download and load Holistic pose estimation
    include_pose="holistic")

rwth_phoenix2014_t = tfds.load(
    name='rwth_phoenix2014_t',
    builder_kwargs=dict(config=config))
```

Furthermore, we follow a unified interface when possible, making attributes the same and comparable between datasets:
```python
{
    "id": tfds.features.Text(),
    "signer": tfds.features.Text() | tf.int32,
    "video": tfds.features.Video(
        shape=(None, HEIGHT, WIDTH, 3)),
    "depth_video": tfds.features.Video(
        shape=(None, HEIGHT, WIDTH, 1)),
    "fps": tf.int32,
    "pose": {
        "data": tfds.features.Tensor(
            shape=(None, 1, POINTS, CHANNELS),
            dtype=tf.float32),
        "conf": tfds.features.Tensor(
            shape=(None, 1, POINTS),
            dtype=tf.float32)
    },
    "gloss": tfds.features.Text(),
    "text": tfds.features.Text()
}
```
